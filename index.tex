for Vascular Surgery clinical practice guidelines for management of
extracranial cerebrovascular disease} (AbuRahma et al. 2022)

\hypertarget{presentation}{%
\section{Presentation}\label{presentation}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{What is the definition of crescendo TIAs?}

  The presenting symptoms of extracranial carotid disease is of the
  utmost importance to understand because it is a major factor in
  determining treatment and prognosis. Focal neurologic symptoms that
  occur suddenly and then resolve within 24 hours are called a transient
  ischemic attack (TIA). If the deficit persists beyond 24 hours, then
  it is considered a stroke. Strokes are then graded according to the
  National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS).(Fischer et al.
  2010)

  A particularly confusing distinction is between a crescendo TIA and a
  stroke in evolution. A crescendo TIA is frequent repetitive
  neurological attacks with complete resolution of the deficit between
  the episodes, usually over a 24 hour period. The result of which is
  the same neurological deficit.(R. Naylor et al. 2023) If the patient
  exhibits progressive deterioration in neurological function between
  TIA episodes this is classified as a stroke in evolution not a
  crescendo TIA.(Ricotta 2019) These are both particularly concerning
  findings and may be an indication for an emergent intervention.
\item
  \textbf{Who needs to be screened for carotid disease?}

  Not everyone should be screened for carotid disease, however, there is
  merit in screening high risk patients as only 15\% of patients
  experience a warning TIA prior to a stroke.(Rockman 2019) The purpose
  of carotid bifurcation imaging is to detect ``stroke-prone'' carotid
  bifurcation plaque and identify a high-risk patient likely to benefit
  from therapy designed to reduce stroke risk.

  Traditionally, the clinical sign associated with asymptomatic carotid
  stenosis is the presence of a neck bruit on auscultation. Focal
  ipsilateral carotid bruits in symptomatic patients has a sensitivity
  of 63\% and a specificity of 61\% for high-grade carotid stenosis
  (range, 70\%-99\%).(Sauve 1994) As these figures suggest the absence
  of carotid bruit does not absolutely exclude the presence of a
  significant carotid bifurcation lesion, therefore additional criteria
  are used to determine which patients would benefit from screening:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Evidence of clinically significant peripheral vascular disease
    regardless of age
  \item
    Patients aged \textgreater65 years with a history of one or more of
    the following atherosclerotic risk factors:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      CAD
    \item
      Smoking
    \item
      Hypercholesterolemia
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

  In general, the more risk factors present, the higher the yield of
  screening for the patient. Presence of a carotid bruit, AAA or family
  history of disease alone is not sufficient to warrant
  imaging.(Aburahma and Perler 2022)
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{evaluation}{%
\section{Evaluation}\label{evaluation}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Ultrasound Imaging}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    US is considered the best, least invasive, and cost effective method
    for detecting carotid stenosis on screening.(Shaalan et al. 2008)
    For more see Section~\ref{sec-extracranial}
  \item
    70-99\% stenosis of ICA - Duplex diagnostic criteria:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      PSV \textgreater/= 230 cm/sec
    \item
      EDV \textgreater100 (EDV \textgreater{} 140 cm/sec most sensitive
      for stenosis \textgreater80\%)
    \item
      Internal/Common Carotid PSV Ratio \textgreater{} 4
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    50-69\% stenosis of ICA - Duplex diagnostic criteria:

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      PSV 125-229 cm/sec
    \item
      EDV 40-100
    \item
      Internal/Common Carotid PSV Ratio 2-4
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    US has a low sensitivity for 50-69\% stenosis. A negative ultrasound
    in symptomatic patients necessitates additional imaging.
  \item
    Velocity-based estimation of carotid artery stenosis may need to be
    adjusted in certain circumstances:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Higher velocities often seen in women than in men.
    \item
      Higher velocities often seen in the presence of contralateral
      carotid artery occlusion.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    High carotid bifurcation, severe arterial tortuosity, extensive
    vascular calcification, and obesity may also reduce the accuracy of
    US imaging.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Other Imaging Modalities}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    CTA

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Pro - fast, sub-millimeter spatial resolution, visualize
      surrounding structures.
    \item
      Con - cost, contrast exposure.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    MRA

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Pro - no contrast administered; can analyze plaque morphology.

\subsection{Medical - Asymptomatic
Patients}\label{medical---asymptomatic-patients}}

First line management for asymptomatic patients with carotid stenosis is
medical optimization of risk factors. The benefit of prophylactic
intervention (CEA/CAS) of even high grade stenosis is estimated at a
1-2\% stroke reduction risk per year. (A. Ross Naylor 2015) In addition,
keep in mind that intervention (CEA/CAS) has only demonstrated a benefit
in asymptomatic patient with life expectancy greater than 3 years.
(Bulbulia and Halliday 2017; Halliday et al. 2010; Rosenfield et al.
2016)

conversation with Prof Ross Naylor} where he discusses in depth his
decision making for asymptomatic carotid disease and other controversies
in carotid disease management.

\end{tcolorbox}

\textbf{Hypertension}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Blood pressure reduction, with a target of \textless140/90 mmHg
  through lifestyle interventions and anti-hypertensive treatment is
  recommended in individuals who have hypertension with asymptomatic
  carotid atherosclerosis or those with TIA or stroke after the
  hyper-acute period.
\item
  Each 10-mm Hg reduction in blood pressure among hypertensive patients
  decreases the risk of stroke by 33\% in patients aged 60-79.(Aiyagari
  and Gorelick 2009)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Diabetes}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In diabetic patients glycaemic control to nearly normoglycemic levels
  (target hemoglobin A1C \textless7\%) is recommended to reduce
  microvascular complications and, with a smaller evidence base,
  macrovascular complications other than stroke.(Ricotta 2019)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Hyperlipidemia}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Statin agents are recommended targeting LDL of 100 mg/dL, for those
  with coronary heart disease or symptomatic atherosclerotic disease,
  and LDL of 70 mg/dL for very high-risk persons with multiple risk
  factors.
\item
  High dose statin therapy in patients with TIA/stroke reduce future
  rates of stroke or cardiovascular events but not overall mortality at
  5 years. (Karam, Loney-Hutchinson, and McFarlane 2008)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Smoking Cessation} - Encouraging smoking cessation is paramount
for these patients. Smoking and carotid disease have been found to have
a dose dependent relationship based on pack-years. Risk of stroke has
been shown to reduce to baseline within 2-4 years of smoking
cessation.(Hicks et al. 2015; Kawachi et al. 1993; Petrik et al. 1995;
P. W. Wilson et al. 1997) For more on smoking cessation, see
Section~\ref{sec-pad-medical-management}

\textbf{Antiplatelet therapy} - Single agent antiplatelet therapy, most
often aspirin, is often all that is needed, but this should be weighted
with other cardiovascular risk factors. A number of trials have showed
limited benefit of adding an additional antiplatelet or routinely
testing for clopidogrel resistance.(Ricotta 2019)

\hypertarget{medical---symptomatic-patients}{%
\subsection{Medical - Symptomatic
Patients}\label{medical---symptomatic-patients}}

Patients who present with a TIA should be placed on dual antiplatelet
therapy, often aspirin and clopidogrel, which are continued through the
workup and treatment of carotid disease. Patients often also have their
blood pressure medications reduced to allow permissive hypertension and
maximize perfusion to at risk cerebral tissue.

While we are not often directly involved in the management of acute
stroke, vascular surgeons should be aware of best practices in this
area. Management of acute stroke currently follow these timelines(Powers
et al. 2018)

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textless{} 4.5 hours from onset of symptoms - medical thrombolysis
  with tPA unless contraindicated.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Patient age \textgreater80 and diabetes are contraindications to tPA
    administration after 3hrs.
  \item
    Other contraindications include - hypertension, intracranial
    hemorrhage, recent stroke or cranial trauma, spine/brain surgery
    within 3 months, GI bleed within 21 days.
  \item
    BP management post stroke \textbf{with thrombolysis} includes
    treatment of BP to \textless185/110 prior to administration of
    thrombolysis, then keep \textless180/105 for 24hrs post
    administration.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textless6 hours from onset of symptoms - catheter directed therapy
\item
  After 6 hours, there is limited benefit to thrombolytic therapy.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    BP management post stroke \textbf{without thrombosis} includes an
    initial period of permissive hypertension, treat only if
    \textgreater220/120. Slowly lower BP to target of 140/90 over 7-14d
    - particularly important to go slow in patients with intra- or
    extra-cranial large vessel stenosis.

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Contraindications to permissive hypertension include active CAD,
      heart failure, aortic dissection, hypertensive encephalopathy.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{indications}{%
\subsubsection{Indications}\label{indications}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Recommendations on when to operate after a TIA/stroke.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Acute stroke with a fixed neurologic deficit of \textgreater6h
    duration - When the patient is medically stable, intervention in 14
    days or less after stroke is preferable. (Rothwell et al. 2004;
    Meershoek and de Borst 2018)
  \item
    Consider urgent intervention in a medically stable patient with
    mild-moderate neurologic deficit, if there is a significant area of
    ischemic penumbra at risk for progression on imaging that is
    contributing to the patient's presentation.
  \item
    Stroke in evolution (fluctuating / evolving neurological deficit) or
    crescendo TIA (repetitive transient ischemia with improvement
    between events) - If the patient's neurological status is not
    stabilized by medical intervention then an urgent CEA should be
    considered.
  \item
    In this clinical context CEA is preferred to CAS based on an
    increased embolic potential of carotid lesions. (Rantner et al.
    2017)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  What is the only emergent indication for CEA?

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Crescendo TIAs or a stroke in evolution with a surgically
    correctable lesion identified on imaging.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{techniques}{%
\subsubsection{Techniques}\label{techniques}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  General concepts

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Patch angioplasty or eversion endarterectomy are recommended over
    primary arterial closure due to decreased ipsilateral stroke,
    perioperative carotid occlusion, return to the operating room,
    restenosis and 1-year stroke rates.(Goodney et al. 2010; K. Rerkasem
    and Rothwell 2009) Patch repair is considered the standard of care
    surgical management for most extracranial carotid lesions.(Arnold
    and Perler 2019)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Neuromonitoring/Shunting options during a carotid
  endarterectomy(Chongruksut, Vaniyapong, and Rerkasem 2014; Wiske et
  al. 2018)

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \textbf{Local/regional anesthesia with direct neurological
    monitoring} - the benefit being that the patient is awake and moving
    to command throughout the case. Indications for shunting include
    lateralizing deficits, seizure, lack of consciousness and severe
    anxiety. Improved neuromonitoring, however, has not been shown to
    reduce myocardial infarction rate with CEA.(A. Rerkasem et al. 2021)
  \item
    \textbf{Stump pressure}- Clamp the inflow and place a butterfly
    attached to a-line tubing into the internal carotid artery. If the
    stump pressure is \textgreater40mmHg the surgeon can chose to
    proceed without shunt placement, if \textless40mmHg then a shunt
    should be placed prior to proceeding. There remains some controversy
    with some literature advocating cutoff as high as 50mmHg or as low
    as 30mmHg.(Arnold and Perler 2019; Chia et al. 2020)
  \item
    \textbf{EEG Neuromonitoring} - EEG tech places neuromonitoring,
    monitored by the technician and neurologist remotely
    intraoperatively. Generally the surgeon should clamp the ICA for 3
    minutes before proceeding, if the patient develops neurological
    deficit/EEG abnormalities with slowing and decreased alpha and beta
    waves, then unclamp, await normalization of EEG, then proceed.
  \item
    \textbf{Cerebral Oximetry} - 15\% decrease in either hemisphere
    should be shunted.
  \item
    \textbf{Transcranial Doppler (TCD)} - severe slowing in the middle
    cerebral artery. An RCT demonstrated that TCD and cerebral oximetry
    changes most accurately predicted cerebral ischemia. Detection of a
    greater than 50\% drop in middle cerebral artery velocity using
    transcranial Doppler is 100\% sensitive for detecting cerebral
    ischemia. (Moritz et al. 2007b) For more see
    Section~\ref{sec-intracranial}.
  \item
    \textbf{Non-selective shunting} - the surgeon uses a shunt for all
    CEAs as standard practice, this is often done for all CEAs performed
    under general anesthesia
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Techniques to reach high internal carotid lesions?(Beretta et al.
  2006)

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    A good knowledge of the available imaging while preparing for the
    procedure is essential when considering the level of the carotid
    bifurcation.
  \item
    Nasotracheal intubation will allow for jaw closure and neck
    extension to facilitate exposure of higher lesions.
  \item
    Division of the posterior belly of the digastric muscle,
    stylopharyngeal muscle, styloglossus muscle, stylomandibular
    ligament or the styloid process. Care should be taken to identify
    and preserve the glossopharyngeal nerve.
  \item
    Division of the occipital artery.
  \item
    Dissection along the posterior parotid gland.
  \item
    ENT surgeon assisted mandible subluxation with assistance if
    previous techniques fail.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  What is the best technique for a patient with an anatomically kinked
  internal carotid artery?

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Eversion carotid endarterectomy (only indication for selection for
    this technique over patch endarterectomy), transection allows for
    reduction of redundancy at re-anastamosis.
  \item
    Otherwise, no advantage has been shown between eversion or patch,
    both can be shunted.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Nerve Injuries -- where you would encounter these and, if injured,
  what deficit would be seen?

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \textbf{Hypoglossal} - Most commonly injured. Usually passes above
    the bifurcation of the carotid artery. If injured the tongue will
    deviate toward the side of injury on protrusion.
  \item
    \textbf{Glossopharyngeal} - Commonly injured during high
    dissections. Found under the posterior digastric muscle. Injury can
    be devastating for patients resulting in difficulty swallowing and
    high aspiration risk.
  \item
    \textbf{Vagus} - Usually found adjacent and lateral to the common
    carotid. Injury can occur with carotid clamping. Patients develop
    hoarseness due to innervation of the laryngeal muscles from the
    recurrent laryngeal nerve which is a branch of the vagus.
  \item
    \textbf{Marginal Mandibular} - Branch of the facial nerve. Runs
    inferior to the angle of the mandible. Commonly a retraction injury
    during high dissections leading to the corner of the ipsilateral lip
    drooping, can be confused with a significant neurological deficit
    following the c ase.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Completion duplex for CEA

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Can identify technical issues with carotid endarterectomy such as
    clamp site injury, thrombosis, intimal flap or dissection, or missed
    disease.(Lipski et al. 1996)

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Acute thrombus may be hypoechoic and difficult to see on B-mode,
      color flow necessary to determine luminal narrowing or occlusion.
      For more see Section~\ref{sec-extracranial}.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Revision required if residual plaque identified with severe velocity
    elevation.(Weinstein et al. 2015)

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Elevated velocities can be seen for many reasons that do not
      require revision, including incorrect technique (compression with
      probe), tortuosity, size discrepancy, ICA spasm.(Ricco et al.
      2013; Weinstein et al. 2015)
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    One study demonstrated that 2.3\% of carotids required revision for
    concerning findings on completion duplex ultrasound.(Ascher et al.
    2004)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{complications}{%
\subsubsection{Complications}\label{complications}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Post-operative stroke - What to do if the patient develops neuro
  deficits following carotid endarterectomy?

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Two main concerns- an intimal flap causing thrombosis or an embolic
    event resulting in a stroke. Perform a thorough neurological exam to
    confirm in operated carotid territory.
  \item
    If in OR -- perform duplex, very low threshold to re-explore and
    confirm patency of ICA with duplex or doppler. If ICA open and
    concerned for distal embolization, then perform a cerebral angiogram
    and proceed with thrombolysis or thrombectomy.(Fletcher et al. 2016)
  \item
    If in Recovery or on the floor -- many would consider CTA first line
    vs duplex to look for thrombosis.
  \item
    ESRD patients have higher rates of perioperative stroke, but also
    have higher rates of stroke if not revascularized. (Klarin et al.
    2016)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Risk factors and how to manage hyperperfusion syndrome?

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Defined as an ipsilateral headache, hypertension, neurological
    deficits likely in distribution of the carotid which can progress to
    seizures and intracranial hemorrhage (75-100\% mortality). Can
    present 2-3 days post surgery.(Kaku, Yoshimura, and Kokuzawa 2004)
  \item
    Patients with uncontrolled hypertension are at risk for
    hyperperfusion syndrome, clinical practice guidelines from SVS
    recommend strict BP control following CEA, with target pressure
    being less than 140/80mmHg or 20mmHg from preoperative
    baseline.(Abou-Chebl et al. 2004; Aburahma and Perler 2022)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Carotid artery patch infections

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Rare complication (\textless1\%) presenting as phlegmon,
    pseudoaneurysm, sinus tract or carotid cutaneous fistula.(Patrick A.
    Stone et al. 2011)
  \item
    Treatment is excision and replacement with autologous tissue.(Fatima
    et al. 2019)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{outcomes-and-surveillence}{%
\subsubsection{Outcomes and
Surveillence}\label{outcomes-and-surveillence}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Recommend follow up US duplex of bilateral carotids at 30 days. If
  stenosis \textgreater50\% is identified, then further imaging is
  indicated.
\item
  Ipsilateral restenosis

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    0-3mo likely due to inadequate endarterectomy or clamp injury.(Kang
    et al. 2014)
  \item
    1-3y likely neointimal hyperplasia, smooth and regular. If
    \textless80\% stenosis and asymptomatic, then duplex surveillance
    and antiplatelet. If progresses, then often endo treatment
    first.(Garzon-Muvdi et al. 2016)
  \item
    Risk factors for restenosis include hyperlipidemia(LaMuraglia et al.
    2005), female gender, primary closure without patch, younger age,
    and certain plaque characteristics-abundance of smooth muscle,
    absence of macrophages/lymphocytes, and lipid core
    \textless10\%.(Hellings et al. 2008; Pauletto et al. 2000)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Contralateral stenosis:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    The risk of progression for moderate stenosis at the initial
    surveillance to severe stenosis in the contralateral artery can be
    as high as 5 times.
  \item
    Requires post-operative surveillance.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{endovascular---carotid-artery-stenting}{%
\subsection{Endovascular - Carotid Artery
Stenting}\label{endovascular---carotid-artery-stenting}}

\hypertarget{indications-1}{%
\subsubsection{Indications}\label{indications-1}}

Limited data is available on CAS in asymptomatic patients - currently is
not supported by guidelines or considered reimbursable.

Consider CAS in symptomatic patients with \textgreater50\% stenosis who
are poor candidates for CEA due to severe uncorrectable medical
comorbidities and/or anatomic considerations

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Ipsilateral neck dissection or XRT - equivalent periprocedural stroke
  rate to CEA, but increased later stroke rate. CEA higher rates of
  cranial nerve damage (9\%). (Giannopoulos et al. 2018)
\item
  Contralateral vocal cord paralysis.
\item
  Lesions that extend proximally to the clavicle or distal to C2.
\end{itemize}

In patients aged \textgreater70 the risk of intra or post procedure
stroke was the highest, if undergoing CAS, presumably due to calcified
disease in the arch.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Lesion-specific characteristics are thought to increase the risk of
  cerebral vascular events after CAS and include a ``soft'' lipid-rich
  plaque identified on noninvasive imaging, extensive (15 mm or more)
  disease, a pre-occlusive lesion, and circumferential heavy
  calcification.
\item
  This risk can be reduced, but not eliminated, by using flow-reversal
  embolic protection rather than distal filter protection.
\end{itemize}

Transfemoral Approach vs Transcarotid approach

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  ROADSTER Trial - single arm study with flow reversal for cerebral
  protection. Suggested lower rates of post-op stroke in patients
  undergoing TCAR.
\item
  TCAR contraindications include previous CCA intervention, CCA disease
  at entry site, \textless5cm CCA (clavicle to bifurcation) for sheath,
  CCA \textless{} 6mm, contralateral recurrent laryngeal or vagus nerve
  injury.(Kwolek et al. 2015)
\item
  Patient needs to be preloaded with dual antiplatelet medications for
  at least 5-7d, should delay procedure if has not been appropriately
  loaded with antiplatelets.(Brott et al. 2010; Kwolek et al. 2015;
  Valls et al. 2017)
\item
  Studies with TCD have shown that there may be reduced embolization
  rates with TCAR over transfemoral stenting.(Plessers et al.
  2016)Complications
\end{itemize}

Post stenting ICA thrombosis should first be treated with abciximab and
catheter directed thrombolysis, followed by endo-salvage with suction
thrombectomy, repeat angioplasty or stenting. May require eventual
conversion to CEA.(Coelho et al. 2019; A. R. Naylor et al. 2018)

\hypertarget{outcomes-and-surveillance}{%
\subsubsection{Outcomes and
Surveillance}\label{outcomes-and-surveillance}}

Dual-platelet therapy should be continued for 1 month after the
procedure, and aspirin should be continued indefinitely.

In stent restenosis (\textgreater50\%) - 4-times higher rate of stroke
than no recurrence of disease, but more benign than de novo
disease.(Clavel et al. 2019)

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Stenosis should be confirmed with CTA. No clear difference between
  treatments in literature - PBA, Cutting, DBA, stenting, open
  conversion.(Arhuidese et al. 2017)
\item
  Repeat angioplasty or stent have low incidence of periprocedural
  stroke but failed to improve long term stroke/death/MI or patency
  rates.(Chung et al. 2016)

    Composite endpoint of 30-day stroke, MI, death equivalent between

Disease}\label{complicated-extracranial-occlusive-disease}}

Occluded Carotid: What is the management of an occluded carotid?

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Leave it alone.
\end{itemize}

What if an occluded carotid on imaging is still causing TIAs?

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Ongoing symptoms in the setting of carotid occlusion is known as
  carotid artery stump syndrome. Symptoms are likely due to emboli from
  friable intima of the internal carotid or from the external carotid
  through collaterals. Treatment is external carotid endarterectomy and
  ligation of the internal carotid.(Hrbáč et al. 2012)
\item
  The addition of oral anticoagulation is likely to reduce the rate of
  recurrent stroke.
\end{itemize}

Simultaneous coronary and carotid disease

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis (50-99\%) will benefit from
  CEA before or concomitant with CABG. The timing of the intervention
  depends on the clinical presentation and institutional experience
  (\emph{grade 2C}).(Aburahma and Perler 2022)
\item
  Patients with severe bilateral asymptomatic carotid stenosis,
  including stenosis and contralateral occlusion, should be considered
  for CEA before or concomitant with CABG (\emph{grade 2C}).(Aburahma
  and Perler 2022)
\item
  Patients undergoing simultaneous CEA/CABG demonstrate highest
  mortality. (A. R. Naylor et al. 2003)
\end{itemize}

What about tandem lesions in the carotid in a symptomatic patient,
carotid bulb and carotid siphon lesion (high ICA)? How should you treat
this?

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Treat carotid bulb and extracranial disease first, likely to be the
  embolic source.
\item
  Treatment of intracranial disease has been shown to increase rates of
  stroke and death.(Chimowitz et al. 2011). Extracranial to intracranial
  bypass has increased risk of stroke over BMT.(E. B. S. Group 1985)
\end{itemize}

What if the patient has severe vertebrobasilar insufficiency and carotid
artery disease?

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Should undergo carotid revascularization first to improve flow. Then
  reassess for vertebrobasilar insufficiency.
\item
  Vertebrobasilar insufficiency characterized by dizziness, ataxia,
  nausea, vertigo and bilateral weakness. (Lima Neto et al. 2017a; Nouh,
  Remke, and Ruland 2014)
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{sec-vertebrobasilar-disease}{%
\subsection{Vertebrobasilar Disease}\label{sec-vertebrobasilar-disease}}

Most common etiology is atherosclerosis, but can also be caused by
embolism, dissection or migraines.(Lima Neto et al. 2017b)

Symptomatic primary vertebral disease with \textgreater60\% stenosis
should be treated. Vertebral divided into segments. V1 preforaminal
(lower than C6), V2 foraminal (C6-C2), V3 (C2-dura), V4
(intracranial).(M. Morasch 2019; Berguer, Morasch, and Kline 1998)

Disease of V1 should be treated with vertebral transposition of bypass
with vein.(Rangel-Castilla et al. 2015)

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Most common complication is Horner's Syndrome due to disruption of the
  sympathetic chain (20\%), next is TIA (1-3\%).(Coleman et al. 2013; C.
  A. Ramirez et al. 2012)
\end{itemize}

Disease of V2 is most difficult to access and should be treated with
bypass from ICA to V3.(Berguer 1985)

RCT of BMT vs endo treatment did not show superiority of endo treatment,
recurrent symptoms most common, periprocedural stroke was rare.(George
A. Antoniou et al. 2012; Coward et al. 2007)

\hypertarget{carotid-artery-dissection}{%
\subsection{Carotid artery dissection}\label{carotid-artery-dissection}}

Patients with carotid dissection should be initially treated with
antithrombotic therapy (antiplatelet agents or anticoagulation)
(\emph{GRADE 1, Level of Evidence C}).

Indications for endovascular treatment of carotid artery dissection
(Cohen et al. 2012; Markus et al. 2019; Pham et al. 2011)

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Ongoing symptoms on best medical therapy
\item
  Contraindication to antithrombotics
\item
  Pseudoaneurysm
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{internal-carotid-artery-aneurysms}{%
\subsection{Internal Carotid Artery
Aneurysms}\label{internal-carotid-artery-aneurysms}}

Defined as dilation of the bulb 200\% of the internal carotid artery or
150\% of the common carotid artery. Like popliteal aneurysms the major
risk is thromboembolization.(Bush, Long, and Atkins 2019; Fankhauser et
al. 2015; Pourier et al. 2018)

Treatment is resection with primary repair or interposition. Distorted
anatomy increased the risk for cranial nerve injury (12\%).(Welleweerd
et al. 2015)

Redundant ICA - should be repaired if patient symptomatic due to
kinking. Treated with resection and primary repair with shortening and
straightening.(Ballotta et al. 2005)

Fibromuscular Dysplasia (FMD)(Jeffrey W. Olin and Sealove 2011) - for
more, see Section~\ref{sec-fibromuscular-dysplasia}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Asymptomatic disease can often be treated with antiplatelets alone.
\item
  Duplex ultrasound demonstrates classic ``chain of lakes'' appearance.
  For more see Section~\ref{sec-extracranial}
\item
  Associated with intracranial aneurysms (13\%), therefore may be
  reasonable to also pursue brain imaging if identified. However, no
  formal guidelines exist.(Lather et al. 2017)
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{carotid-body-tumors-cbt}{%
\subsection{Carotid Body Tumors (CBT)}\label{carotid-body-tumors-cbt}}

\hypertarget{demographics}{%
\subsubsection{Demographics}\label{demographics}}

One quarter (25\%) are associated with a germline mutation or familial
history. Genetic testing recommended in patients with multifocal tumors,
associated paraganglioma, pheochromocytoma or family history. SDHD gene
mutation is most common associated with familial paraganglioma.(Davila
et al. 2016; Kruger et al. 2010)

Blood supply primarily from the external carotid artery.(Robertson et
al. 2019; Davila et al. 2016)

Shamblin criteria utilized to determine difficulty of resection and is
associated with rates of carotid reconstruction or cranial nerve
injury.(Chow, Moore, and Lamuraglia 2019; Shamblin et al. 1971)

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Type 1 - abut but do not involve internal or external carotid arteries
  or cranial nerves can be easily dissected.
\item
  Type 2 - partially surround external carotid artery or cranial nerves
  and may be dissected free but risk injury to these structures.
\item
  Type 3 - fully surround either internal or external carotid artery or
  cranial nerves and pose a high risk of injury and need for
  reconstruction.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{management-1}{%
\subsubsection{Management}\label{management-1}}

Risk of injury or revascularization during resection determined by
Shamblin criteria as discussed above. In patients with Shamblin Type 3
or with involvement of the internal carotid, these patients should be
evaluated for carotid artery ligation.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  When involved with a CBT or other skull base tumors, cerebral
  perfusion should be thoroughly evaluated prior to surgical resection
  to determine whether a patient will tolerate carotid ligation.
\item
  Evaluation includes balloon occlusion testing with xenon-enhanced
  SPECT imaging. Low risk for ligation if no neurologic deficits (after
  30min and hypotensive challenge) and normal diffusion of SPECT (ratio
  of \textgreater0.9). Angiography with contralateral occlusion
  evaluates collaterals.(Sugawara et al., n.d.; Tansavatdi et al. 2015)
\end{itemize}

Embolization if tumor arterial inflow may help reduce risk of
perioperative blood loss but is not associated with reduced cranial
nerve injury. Resection should take place 24-36hrs after
embolization.(Power et al. 2012)

\item
  Control of catastrophic bleeding --- with manual compression and
  resuscitation
\item
  Ensure that injury is not causing airway compromise
\item
  Evaluate the neurological status of patient --- have a thorough
  baseline neuro exam and look for signs of ischemia, hemispheric
  stroke, arousability/mental status
\item
  Prevent secondary injury --- maintain blood pressure to maintain
  cerebral perfusion pressure and prevent hypoxia
\item
  After appropriate exposure and control, recommend that patient be
  heparinized during carotid artery repair. Be prepared for bleeding,
  especially in patients with polytrauma. Resuscitate appropriately
  until repair completed.

  visualization of injury above the angle of the mandible (distal
  internal carotid and proximal thoracic outlet)
\item
  These imaging modalities are used to assess visibility of defect
  (i.e.~dissection, thrombus, intimal flap) and degree of flow
  limitation by measured velocity.

\item
  Grade IV: Occlusion
\item
  Grade V: Transection with free extravasation
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{management-2}{%
\subsection{Management}\label{management-2}}

\textbf{Considerations}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Consider the overall injury severity of the trauma patient with any
  concomitant injuries that may prevent antiplatelet/anticoagulation
  initiation (i.e.~TBI) or intervention(Bromberg et al. 2010)

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Oftentimes have other blunt vascular injuries, such as aortic
    injuries, that need to be addressed as well
  \item
    Can consider delay of intervention (approx. 7 days) to decrease risk
    of neurological events
  \end{itemize}
\item
  If there is a change in the neurological exam after initiation of
  medical management, considered as failure of medical therapy and
  surgical intervention is indicated
\item
  If unable to obtain a reliable neurological exam, can consider
  transcranial doppler or EEG if accessible, but is not mandatory
\item
  Continue supportive measures to prevent secondary injuries,
  i.e.~optimize cerebral perfusion pressure
\item
  Repeat imaging with change in neurological status
\item
  Serial imaging important in assessing whether injury has evolved
\item
  Endovascular repair usually involves transfemoral approach for access
  with arch aortogram, selection of defective carotid vessel, and
  placement of the endovascular treatment (ie: stent graft, bare metal
  stent, coil embolization of pseudoaneurysm)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Carotid Artery Injury Treatments}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Grade I and II injuries are recommended to be treated medically with
  antiplatelet/anticoagulation therapy if patient is able to tolerate

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Repeat CTA imaging in 5-7 days while inpatient to ensure that injury
    has not evolved in acute phase
  \item
    Follow-up CTA imaging within 1 month of discharge as outpatient to
    assess healing. Imaging needs to be continued until there is
    resolution of lesion.
  \item
    Grade I lesions typically improve over time, Grade II lesions or
    higher have a greater chance of evolving (approximately 60\%)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Accessible Grade III and V carotid injuries should be repaired.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Grade III pseudoaneurysms should be repaired endovascularly with a
    covered stent (ie stent graft that covers the opening of the
    pseudoaneurysm) or bare metal stent (maintains integrity of the
    wall). Through these stents, coils can be placed to thrombose the
    pseudoaneurysm. Flow needs to be maintained.
  \item
    Open approach can be considered for Zone II injuries
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Grade I and IV carotid injuries, and inaccessible Grade II and III
  carotid injuries should be treated with medical management
  (antiplatelet/anticoagulation)

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Grade IV injuries without associated injuries that preclude use of
    anticoagulation, would heparinize and proceed with anticoagulation
    (avoid bolus of heparin, goal PTT 50-70 within first 24 hours).
    Monitor for bleeding. Transition to oral anticoagulant for 30-90
    days.
  \item
    Grade IV injuries with contraindications for anticoagulation, would
    recommend dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and clopidogrel)
  \item
    Overall, anticoagulation is preferred if there are no
    contraindications. If there are, then dual antiplatelet therapy is
    preferred.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Grade V and persistent Grade III should be repaired surgically
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Vertebral Artery Injury Treatments}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Special Considerations

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Attempt to determine whether the dominant or diminutive vertebral
    artery is involved
  \item
    Treatment is again based on severity with grading system (Denver
    Grading Scale), consider location and extent
  \item
    Consider any associations with a basilar artery defect or posterior
    circulation stroke
  \item
    Grade I-IV vertebral injuries should be treated with medical
    management as first line, approximately 90\% self-resolve
  \item
    Endovascular interventions can be considered for those patients with
    severe injury and/or who are symptomatic

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Usually performed by neuro-interventionalist as the injury is
      located within the skull base
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Serial imaging still needs to be performed to evaluate healing
    (similar manner to carotid injury)
  \item
    In the setting of trauma, if there is an expanding hematoma due to
    vertebral artery injury and open approach is performed to control
    bleeding, vertebral artery is usually ligated in this scenario

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Vertebral reconstructions are not well-suited for traumas
    \end{itemize}

\item
  Repair carotid artery if injured, even if thrombosed.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    The risk of reperfusion injury causing an intracranial hemorrhage
    was traditionally considered a reason to not repair.
  \item
    However, overall mortality and final neurostatus has shown to be
    better with intervention, even if patient started with
    neurodeficits.
  \item

\item
  Scenario: Patient has large cerebral infarct on same side as carotid
  injury.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Continue to OR to explore
  \item
    Preferred management is to repair and attempt reperfusion of
    hemisphere, possibly perfusing a previously ischemic penumbra
  \item
    Ligation usually not an option.

  \item
    Observation without repair can risk evolution of the injury into
    pseudoaneurysm with need to repair and reoperate days/weeks later -
    Outcome of this repair is likely a stroke
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Repair Techniques}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Appropriate exposure of carotid artery (see above for details)
\item
  Gain proximal and distal control
\item
  Identify injury
\item
  Remove burden of thrombus (if present)

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Thrombus burden must be removed prior to repair
  \item
    Via flushing from back-bleeding and forward-bleeding of internal
    carotid artery - Via Fogarty or thrombectomy catheter, carefully

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Recommend 2 French or 3 French size
    \item
      Pass only 1-2 cm up into distal internal carotid
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Debride any devitalized tissue prior to repair

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    May cause defect to be larger, but repair requires healthy tissue
    planes
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Repair carotid - Heparinization required when repairing carotid artery
  and/or clamping. Be efficient, as these patients usually have
  significant polytrauma and other areas that are susceptible to
  bleeding which will need to be controlled when heparin administered.
  Repair options, include:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Primary Repair
  \item
    Patch Repair - Used for short-segment injuries. Conduits include:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Dacron or bovine pericardium
    \item
      Autologous vein - Not first-line due to extra time required for
      harvest. Used if there is concern for contamination (i.e.~shot gun
      wound with large soft tissue injury, aerodigestive injury, etc)
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Interposition Graft - Used for long-segment injuries. Conduits
    include:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Autologous vein (great saphenous vein) - Good option when there is
      concomitant aerodigestive injury. Consider shunting while waiting
      for harvest
    \item
      Synthetic (i.e.~Dacron/PTFE)
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Transposition of Internal Carotid Artery to External Carotid artery
    - Can avoid need for shunting
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Consideration of Shunting}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  In most cases, shunting not required because adds extra level of
  complexity to trauma case that may not have the luxury of time
\item
  Cases where shunting can be used:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Interposition graft repair for long-segment carotid injury that
    requires vein harvest \textgreater{} shunting can be performed to
    reperfuse the affected brain hemisphere while waiting for conduit
    preparation
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Typical shunts used: Argyle or Sundt
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Assessment of Repair}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Assess repair with removal of thrombus and once back-bleeding restored
\item
  Duplex US

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Best option when time is limited to assess flow
  \item
    Usually also used most often with elective carotid repairs
  \item
    If ultrasound is not available, then a continuous wave doppler is at
    least necessary to demonstrate monophasic signal with diastolic flow
    in the revascularized internal carotid artery.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Intraoperative arteriograms

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    If have luxury of time to perform and set up is appropriate, used
    for completion studies
  \item
    Documents complete evacuation of distal thrombus
  \item
    Performed by placing 18-gauge butterfly needle in CCA (remove air)
    and inject contrast to view repair and distal internal carotid to
    ensure lack of thrombus
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Consideration of Drains}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  If there is contamination (aerodigestive injury), then can place a
  small JP drain (7mm) to protect the repair
\item
  Buttressing repair in contaminated cases usually not used as the neck
  is highly vascular

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Can consider a muscle flap to separate arterial injury from
    esophageal injury (commonly not seen) with gross contamination
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Guideline Algorithm for Penetrating Neck Trauma(Sperry et al. 2013)

\hypertarget{internal-jugular-vein-injuries}{%
\section{Internal Jugular Vein
Injuries}\label{internal-jugular-vein-injuries}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  If patient has significant TBI, consider repairing Internal Jugular
  venous injuries to maintain venous outflow to that side of the brain
  --- especially if there is a transduced venous pressure gradient.
  Cases include patients who have intracranial hypertension and require
  a decompressive craniectomy.
\item
  Otherwise, able to ligate without much consequential effects in most
  patients due to appropriate amounts of collateral outflow.

\textbf{What are the zones of the upper extremity?}(Karl A. Illig 2019)

Division of the upper extremity into three zones:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Intrathoracic Zone: Inclusive of the aortic arch and its branches,
  innominate artery (dividing into right subclavian and right common
  carotid), left subclavian artery and left common carotid artery, as
  well as the innominate veins, and SVC.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Arch classification helps determine difficulty of accessing the
    right innominate from a femoral approach. Type 1 innominate does not
    break the plane of the outer curve, Type 2 it is between the outer
    curve and inner curve and Type 3 it falls below the inner curve of
    the aortic arch.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Thoracic Outlet: Extends from the base of neck to the axilla. Includes
  the subclavian, proximal vertebral, and proximal axillary arteries, as
  well as the corresponding veins).
\item
  Axilla to Fingers: The arm.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{What are some common exposures for major upper extremity
arteries?}(Karl A. Illig 2019; Gary G Wind and R. James Valentine 2013)

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Proximal Right Subclavian Artery:} Access through a median
  sternotomy.
\item
  \textbf{Proximal Left Subclavian Artery:} An anterolateral thoracotomy
  is required in emergent settings for proximal left subclavian artery
  control.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    For proximal, mid and distal exposure is required a ``trap door''
    exposure is used which is a combined anterolateral thoracotomy,
    third space sternotomy, and left supraclavicular incision.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Mid and Distal Subclavian Artery}: Access through a
  supraclavicular Incision. After division of the platysma and
  clavicular head of the SCM, a fat pat of varying thickness is
  encountered which contains the omohyoid muscle.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    This should be divided and placed supero-laterally. At this point,
    the anterior scalene muscle is exposed medially with the phrenic
    nerve running in a lateral to medial direction, which should be
    identified and preserved.
  \item
    In a carotid/subclavian bypass division of the anterior scalene
    should be performed as close to the first rib as possible. Once
    divided the subclavian artery is exposed.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Axillary Artery:} Exposure is gained through an
  infraclavicular incision, below the middle third of the clavicle.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Pectoralis major is divided and pectoralis minor is freed at the
    lateral margin of the wound. The axillary vein should be identified
    and followed supero-deeply to identify and expose the artery.
    Anatomically bound by the first rib proximally and the lateral edge
    of the teres major muscle distally.
  \item
    For exposure of the first part of the axillary artery, the
    ipsilateral arm is abducted approximately 90 degrees and a
    horizontal skin incision 2 cm below the middle third of the clavicle
    should be made. The underlying pectoralis major is split by bluntly
    separating the fibers, exposing the tough clavipectoral fascia. At
    the lateral wound margin, the pectoralis minor can be freed and
    laterally retracted.
  \item
    The axillary vein is the first structure to be encountered in the
    fascia and the artery lies just superior and deep to the vein. Make
    sure to protect the nerves of the brachial plexus which lie deep to
    the first part of axillary artery and are at risk of injury during
    blind placement of occluding arterial clamps.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Brachial Artery, Upper Arm:} The brachial artery's superficial
  location makes it vulnerable to injury and accounts for most vascular
  injuries of the upper extremities.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Brachial artery exposure involves a 5-8 cm longitudinal incision in
    the groove between the biceps/triceps muscles on the medial aspect
    of the arm. In the lower half of the arm, take care to avoid basilic
    vein damage as it runs in the subcutaneous tissue.
  \item
    The neurovascular bundle is exposed by incising the deep fascia at
    the medial border of the biceps muscle, which then should be
    retracted anteriorly. The basilic vein should be identified and
    retracted into the posterior wound.
  \item
    On opening the brachial sheath the median nerve is the most
    superficial structure and should be identified, protected and
    retracted. The brachial artery lies deep to the median nerve and is
    flanked by two brachial veins. Be mindful that the ulnar nerve lies
    posteriorly.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Brachial Artery, Antecubital Fossa:} Exposure of the brachial
  artery in the antecubital fossa requires a transverse skin incision 1
  cm distal to the midpoint of the antecubital crease.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    After deepening, mobilize the basilic vein medially to avoid injury.
    The medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve should be identified and
    protected. The bicipital aponeurosis should be divided to exposure
    the brachial artery, which is flanked by two deep veins crossing
    tributaries.
  \item
    To isolate the brachial artery ligation and division of these
    tributaries is required. The brachial artery bifurcates at the
    radial tuberosity into its radial and ulnar branches.
  \item
    Immediately after the ulnar artery arises from the bifurcation
    origin, it gives off a short common interosseous branch, which
    bifurcates at the hiatus in the proximal interosseous membrane.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Radial Artery at the Wrist:} This requires a 2-3 cm
  longitudinal incision generally between the palpable radial artery and
  cephalic vein.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Incision of the antebrachial fascia medially to the radius should
    expose the radial artery. Two veins accompany the artery and should
    be dissected away to isolate the artery.
  \item
    The superficial radial nerve and its medial/lateral branches course
    between the cephalic vein and radial artery in this area.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Ulnar Artery:} The ulnar artery courses beneath the
  superficial flexor muscles of the proximal forearm, emerging near the
  ulnar border at the midpoint between the elbow and the wrist.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    In the distal forearm, the ulnar artery runs just deep to the
    antebrachial fascia and is easily exposed through a longitudinal
    incision placed radially to the flexor carpi ulnaris.
  \item
    The palmar branch of the ulnar nerve courses superficially to the
    antebrachial fascia and should be preserved during arterial exposure
    to avoid injury.
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{What common aberrant upper extremity/arch anatomy is important
to be aware of?}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Bovine Arch:} Where the innominate and left common carotid
  arteries share a common origin.(Layton et al. 2006)
\item
  \textbf{Aberrant Vertebral Artery:} Where the vertebral artery arises
  directly from the aortic arch.
\item
  \textbf{Aberrant Right Subclavian Artery:} Where there is no
  innominate artery and instead the right common carotid arises directly
  from the aorta.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Confusingly the right subclavian artery, then originates from the
    aortic arch distal to the left subclavian artery.
  \item
    To supply the right arm it therefore, needs to pass behind the
    esophagus.
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

Of note, thoracic aortic disease is associated with aberrant anatomy,
with high rates of bovine arch (25\%), isolated L vertebral (6-8\%), and
aberrant R subclavian (1-2\%).(Dumfarth et al. 2015)

\hypertarget{etiology}{%

\textbf{How does evaluation of upper extremity ischemia differentiate
from lower extremity ischemia?}

Upper extremity ischemia \textless5\% of patients with limb ischemia are
a result of underlying atherosclerosis, which is in contrast to lower
extremity.(Shuja 2019)

Vast majority of cases caused by embolic, autoimmune, or connective
tissue disorders.

\textbf{How can upper extremity disease be classified?}

Anatomic Location:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Large vs.~Small Vessel
\end{itemize}

Disease Process:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Vaso-occlusive disease often requires endovascular/surgical
  management.
\item
  Vasospastic disease is more responsive to pharmacological management.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{evaluation-2}{%
\subsection{Evaluation}\label{evaluation-2}}

\textbf{How should patients be evaluated who have concern for upper
extremity disease?}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Detailed H+P evaluation (pulse palpation, auscultation at
  supraclavicular/infraclavicular fossa may reveal a bruit concerning
  for subclavian artery stenosis, upper extremity neurovascular/skin
  exam)
\item
  Brachial/forearm blood pressures and if suspected claudication,
  measured at rest and 2-5 minutes after exercise. Look for a gradient
  of \textgreater20 mmHg is considered significant
\item
  Some or all of 6 P's of acute limb ischemia with symptoms occurring
  within 14 days are deemed acute
\item
  Doppler insonation of radial, ulnar, palmar, and digital arteries
\item
  Vascular Lab Evaluation

  \begin{enumerate}

\subsection{Demographics}\label{demographics-1}}

\textbf{What are causes and symptoms associated with subclavian/axillary
occlusive disease?} (Jack L Cronenwett, Alik Farber, and Erica L.
Mitchell 2020)

\textbf{Etiology:} Atherosclerosis is the most common cause of
subclavian/axillary occlusive disease. Left SCA \textgreater{} Right
involvement. Less common causes include Takayasu disease, giant cell
arteritis, or arterial TOS

\textbf{Symptoms:} Upper extremity arm/hand ischemia or neurologic
symptoms due to subclavian-vertebral steal.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Because significant collaterals, minimal pain on exertion even with
  subclavian occlusion.
\item
  Innominate disease can present with complex steal syndrome from the
  vertebral artery.(Rodriguez 2016)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What are causes and symptoms associated with brachial/forearm
occlusive disease?}

\textbf{Etiology:} MCC of brachial artery occlusion is cardiac origin
embolus.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Atherosclerosis RARELY affects the brachial artery. Forearm occlusive
  disease can be seen in advanced ESRD or DM where calcific
  atherosclerosis of radial/ulnar arteries is present.
\item
  Distal axillary/proximal brachial stenosis can be from repetitive
  trauma from crutch use.
\item
  Radiation arteritis - may be seen with radiation after breast cancer
  therapy. Lesions characteristically tapered with smooth border. May
  occur alongside a brachial plexopathy.(Goldstein et al. 2010; Modrall
  and Sadjadi 2003)
\item
  Less common causes include Buerger's disease or Raynaud Phenomenon
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{chronic-limb-threatening-ischemia}{%
\subsubsection{Chronic Limb Threatening
Ischemia}\label{chronic-limb-threatening-ischemia}}

\textbf{How/when is upper extremity occlusive disease treated?}

\textbf{Indications for treatment}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  70\% stenosis and associated symptoms or deficit
\item
  Lesion with ipsilateral ICA requiring treatment
\item
  Pre-occlusive lesion in a good surgical candidate (\textgreater5y life
  expectancy)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Innominate or SCA Occlusive Disease}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Endovascular with balloon expandable stent via femoral or ipsilateral
  brachial artery. (Chatterjee et al. 2013; Bradaric et al. 2015; Saha
  et al. 2017; Palchik et al. 2008; Mordasini et al. 2011) Preferred in:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Short segment or ostial disease with adequate distance to the
    vertebral artery origin.
  \item
    History of neck surgery or radiation.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Surgery:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Bypass from aortic arch through median sternotomy - Most durable
    option, particularly for dense R innominate disease, so preferred in
    patients who can tolerate.

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Endarterectomy not appropriate if disease involves the
      origin.(Aiello and Morrissey 2011; Mansukhani et al. 2018;
      Berguer, Morasch, and Kline 1998; Daniel et al. 2014; Reul et al.
      1991; Berguer et al. 1999; Byrne et al. 2007)
    \item
      Complications include compression of the graft on sternal closure,
      so proximal anastomosis should be placed to the side of the aorta.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Ipsilateral CCA to subclavian artery (bypass or transposition) -
    Recent NSQIP study showed no difference in stroke and death for CS
    bypass vs transposition, therefore procedure should be determined by
    anatomic constraints.(Cinà et al. 2002; Vliet et al. 1995) Small
    studies and systematic reviews have shown that patency of carotid
    subclavian bypass is better with synthetic graft than with
    autologous vein.(AbuRahma, Robinson, and Jennings 2000; Illuminati
    et al. 2018; Ziomek et al. 1986)

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      An additional indication for carotid subclavian bypass is as a
      staged revascularization prior to TEVAR for aneurysmal disease
      requiring coverage of the LSA
    \item
      \textbf{How does the exposure differentiate in transposition vs
      bypass?}

      \begin{itemize}
      \item
        Arterial transposition via a short, transverse cervical incision
        above the clavicle between two heads of SCM (bypass is lateral
        to entire SCM)
      \item
        Sub-platysmal flaps created and avoid EJ vein damage
      \item
        Omohypoid divided between heads of SCM and IJ mobilized
        laterally (bypass IJ is mobilized medially to expose CCA and
        care must be taken to avoid phrenic nerve in more lateral
        approach)
      \item
        CCA is reflected medially with vagus nerve
      \item
        On the left side, the thoracic duct is identifiable and divided
        followed by dividing the vertebral vein
      \item
        Subclavian artery and proximal branches identified (anterior
        scalene is in lateral dissection)
      \end{itemize}
    \item
      \textbf{What are some common complications after carotid
      subclavian bypass in order of highest to lowest incidence?}

      \begin{enumerate}
      \def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
      \item
        Phrenic nerve palsy (most common) - most often managed
        conservatively.
      \item
        Recurrent laryngeal palsy
      \item
        Lymphatic leak, seen more on the L with thoracic duct injury
      \item
        Neck hematoma(Voigt et al. 2019)
      \end{enumerate}
    \item
      \textbf{When carotid-subclavian bypass compared to transposition?}

      \begin{enumerate}
      \def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
      \item
        Vertebral artery takes origin from the subclavian artery in a
        very proximal position or is dominant over the contralateral
        side, then bypass preferred. (M. D. Morasch 2009a)
      \item
        For coronary-subclavian steal with patent internal mammary
        artery to coronary artery bypass graft, then bypass (a
        carotid-subclavian transposition requires a more proximal clamp
        with occlusion of inline antegrade flow to the coronary bypass
        during the procedure) (Cua et al. 2017)
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Contralateral CCA bypass with anterior or retropharyngeal tunneling.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Brachial/forearm Occlusive disease}

Endovascular: PTA evidence is anecdotal with stents for lesions
unresponsive to PTA or dissection following angioplasty.(Cheun et al.
2019; Nasser et al. 2014; Dineen, Smith, and Arko 2007)

Surgery: GSV vein bypass remains standard for revascularization with
bypasses to superficial or deep palmar arch have good patency rates.
Tunneling is subcutaneous if to distal ulnar or superficial palmar arch
whereas anatomical to distal radial artery over the anatomic
snuffbox.(B. B. Chang et al. 2003; Masden, Seruya, and Higgins 2012;
Spinelli et al. 2010)

\hypertarget{acute-limb-ischemia}{%
\subsubsection{Acute Limb Ischemia}\label{acute-limb-ischemia}}

\textbf{What is the procedure of choice in acute limb ischemia of the
upper extremity?}

With acute presentation of upper limb ischemia and a localizing
examination, may be reasonable to proceed directly to OR for embolectomy
to minimize ischemia time.(Wahlberg, Goldstone, and Olofsson 2006; Henke
2009)

\textbf{What are some postoperative complications of an embolectomy for
acute limb ischemia?}

Brachial sheath hematoma - parasthesias and weakness in the median nerve
distribution require emergent re-exploration and decompression. Even
small hematomas that are not readily identifiable on clinical exam, can
cause compression on the median nerve and are a surgical emergency.(D.
D. Tran and Andersen 2011)

Compartment Syndrome - If prolonged ischemia or no hematoma found, and
forearm compartments appear tense, then should proceed with fasciotomies
to treat forearm compartment syndrome. Rarely performed prophylactically
due to significant morbidity.(Gelberman et al. 1981; Kistler, Ilyas, and
Thoder 2018; Leversedge et al. 2011)

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Three compartments - forearm volar (flexor, superficial, and deep),
  mobile wad (lateral), and dorsal (extensor, superficial, and deep).
  Volar compartments most susceptible to ischemia and compartment
  syndrome, most vulnerable muscle are flexor digitorum profundas and
  flexor pollicus longus.(Ronel, Mtui, and Nolan 2004)
\item
  Volar/Henry approach decompresses lateral and volar compartments with
  a single incision, includes carpal tunnel release.

Ischemia}\label{iatrogenic-or-vasopressor-induced-ischemia}}

\textbf{You are called to the intensive care unit for a septic patient
with acute bilateral upper limb ischemia, what is the management
strategy?}

Critically ill patients on vasopressors with bilateral upper extremity
ischemia are often managed best with supportive measures and attempts to
wean vasopressors (especially norepinephrine).(Gregory J. Landry et al.
2018)

Limited role for radial artery embolectomy, only in clear ischemia
isolated to the distribution of an occluded radial artery, often
secondary to line placement.(Valentine, Modrall, and Clagett 2005)

\hypertarget{raynauds-phenomenon}{%
\subsection{Raynaud's Phenomenon}\label{raynauds-phenomenon}}

\textbf{What is Raynaud's and what causes it?}

Exaggeration of normal physiologic response with episodic pallor or
cyanosis of the fingers caused by small digital artery vasoconstriction
occurring in response to cold or emotional stress. There is an
abnormality with sympathetic nervous system, resulting in a
multifactorial problem involving a combination of vascular, neural, and
humoral factors.(Shuja 2019; Gregory J. Landry 2019)

\textbf{What are the subtypes of Raynaud's phenomenon and what is the
underlying pathology?}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Primary: Raynaud's disease-idiopathic form that is a benign process
  not associated with structural vascular change. Triggers include
  (cold, emotional stress, caffeine) resulting in digital smooth muscle
  contraction and temporary digital hypoperfusion.
\item
  Secondary: Fixed vascular obstruction to blood flow decreasing
  threshold for cold induced vasospasm or progress to tissue loss.
  Diseases associated include mixed connective tissue disease, SLE, and
  rheumatoid arthritis, and scleroderma (accounts for 80-90\% of cases).
  In setting of lower digital blood pressure, symptomatic digital
  ischemia or tissue loss under low stress conditions. With
  cold/emotional stress, vasoconstrictive response of digital artery
  smooth muscle further causes arterial closure and resultant symptoms
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{What are diagnostic criteria for Raynaud's?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Clinical (Progression of ischemia with white -\textgreater{} blue
  -\textgreater{} red finger discoloration. Episodes can be self-limited
  and may last from less than a minute, but generally not longer than
  10-20 minutes
\item
  Qualitative testing for severity of cold sensitivity in Raynaud's
  syndrome can be useful. Most basic test is cold sensitivity and
  recovery after ice water immersion. \textgreater10 minutes return to
  baseline pressure concerning for Raynaud's
\item
  Segmental pressures with finger systolic blood pressure can
  differentiate purely vasospastic vs occlusive disease. Difference of
  more than 15 mm Hg between fingers or absolute finger pressure
  \textless70 mm Hg may indicate occlusive disease
\item
  Serologic evaluation (ANA/RF)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What are appropriate treatments for Raynaud's phenomenon?}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Medical-cold/tobacco avoidance lead to improvement in around half of
  patients. Calcium channel blocker (nifedipine ER 30mg qday) and
  losartan (50mg BID) have been shown to be most effective.(Gregory J.
  Landry 2013; Wigley and Flavahan 2016) Other drugs include alpha
  blocker, sildenafil, fluoxetine (SSRI), reserpine, cilostazol,
  captopril.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    OUTCOMES ARE POOR IN PATIENTS WITH ARTERIAL OBSTRUCTION. If there is
    an asymmetric vascular examination, then further non-invasive
    vascular imaging is needed.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Surgical-thoracic sympathectomy (used for treatment of digital artery
  vasospasm/digital ischemic ulceration). For vasospasm, thoracic
  sympathectomy is initially successful, but symptoms return generally
  within 3-6 months.
\item
  Immunosuppression/immunomodulation for connective tissue disorders
  associated with secondary Raynaud phenomenon
\end{enumerate}

See Landry's Review in JVS for a good treatment algorithm.(Gregory J.
Landry 2013)

\hypertarget{ergotism}{%
\subsection{Ergotism}\label{ergotism}}

\textbf{What is Ergotism?}

Ergot is a parasitic fungal disease that has a particular prevalence for
infecting rye plants and ergot alkaloids have been linked to epidemic
poisonings that manifested as ergotism from consumption of rye.
\textbf{Modern day is rare.}(Stanley, Veith, and Wakefield 2014)

\textbf{What causes Ergotism and how do patients present?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Ergotamine is chemically like endogenous catecholamines/indolamines
  and when applied clinically, it behaves as an agonist to
  alpha-adrenergic, sertoninergic, and dopaminergic receptors. Can be
  seen with ergot alkaloid migraine medications. Despite limited
  bioavailability, vasocontrictive effects have been reported to last
  for 24 hours or longer
\item
  Gangrenous-mild limb pain followed by burning pain/shooting and
\item
  Convulsive-heaviness in limbs and head associated with diarrhea. Could
  result in tonic-clonic spasms
\end{itemize}

\textbf{How can you diagnose Ergotism and what is the process for
treating this disease?}

Upper extremity ischemia (i.e.~digital ulceration) in the setting of
ergot alkaloid use (typically for migraines). The treatment includes:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Volume expansion and IV heparin as anticoagulation
\item
  IV infusion of nitroprusside, nitroglycerin, iloprost or combination
\item
  Infusion of Ca 2+ channel blockers
\item
  Surgical: for thrombosis, consider thrombolysis. Avoid or delay
  amputations as much as possible to maximize amount of tissue recovery.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{sec-buergers-disease}{%
\subsection{Buerger's Disease}\label{sec-buergers-disease}}

\textbf{How is Buerger's disease categorized?}

Non-atherosclerotic, segmental, inflammatory disease of small/medium
sized arteries in distal extremities (upper and lower) of tobacco users
distinct from either atherosclerosis of immune arteritis(Jack L
Cronenwett, Alik Farber, and Erica L. Mitchell 2020; Le Joncour et al.
2018)

\textbf{What clinical criteria can help diagnose Buerger's?}

Diagnosis of Buerger's disease requires 5 criteria(Akar 2019)

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Smoking history
\item
  Onset before age 45 or 50
\item
  Distal extremity ischemia with infrapopliteal arterial occlusions and
  often upper limb involvement
\item
  Classic angiographic findings of segmental occlusions of distal
  arteries with corkscrew collaterals
\item
  Absence of atherosclerotic risk factors (besides smoking, of course),
  autoimmune disease, diabetes or proximal embolic source.
\end{enumerate}

Although rarely are biopsy sent, pathology will show panvasculitis
within small and medium-sized arteries, highly cellular intraluminal
thrombus (contains CD68, Cd3, Cd8 inflammatory cells), preserved elastic
lamina structure, unlike atherosclerotic lesions.(Akar 2019; M.
Kobayashi et al. 1999)

\textbf{What is important about diagnosing Buerger's}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Typically a diagnosis of exclusion
\item
  Must rule out proximal embolic source, trauma, local lesions (e.g.~pop
  entrapment or cystic adventitial disease), autoimmune disease,
  hypercoagulable status, atherosclerosis
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What physical exam and non-invasive/invasive imaging findings of
Buerger's?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Distal, but not proximal arterial disease (palpable brachial/popliteal
  but absent/reduced at ankle or wrist)
\item
  Digital brachial index (DBI) \textless0.6 and flat/reduced digital
  waveforms
\item
  CTA/MRA/DSA or duplex - characteristic findings of
  serpiginous/corkscrew collaterals, occlusion of distal calf/pedal
  arteries, and normal proximal arteries.(K. Busch 2011; Fujii et al.
  2011)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What is the mainstay treatment in Buerger's disease?}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Smoking cessation!} Only treatment to improve symptoms and
  reduce amputation risk if achieved before onset of gangrene or tissue
  loss. May even require inpatient admission for intensive smoking
  cessation therapy.(Hooten, Bruns, and Hays 1998) It is important to
  remember following treatments will likely fail without smoking
  cessation.(J. W. Olin 2000)
\item
  If smoking cessation does not improve, medical management with
  antiplatelet agents, immunomodulators, vasodilators (Calcium channel
  blockers and cilostazol(Dean and Satiani 2001)), anticoagulants(Kubota
  et al. 1997), and IPC.(Montori et al. 2002)
\item
  Endovascular-distal small vessel intervention
\item
  Surgical-upper extremity autogenous vein bypass-limited success due to
  poor outflow
\item
  Sometimes can consider upper extremity sympathectomy, but unproven
  benefit
\item
  Amputation-reported in 30-40\% who are followed longer than 5
  years(Jeffrey W. Olin 2018)
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{sec-large-vasculitis}{%

\textbf{What are common characteristics for patients who are suspected
to have a large vessel vasculitis?} (Shanmugam 2019; Weyand and Goronzy
2003)

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Affect aorta and major branches
\item
  Present with non-specific heterogenous symptoms making the diagnosis
  challenging. Most commonly, they present with systemic or
  constitutional symptoms (fatigue, fever, weight loss, arthralgias)
\item
  Frequently, diagnosis made with presence of constitutional symptoms,
  elevated inflammatory markers (ESR/CRP), and dedicated imaging (MRA,
  CTA, DUS, or PET)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{How can you differentiate Takayasu arteritis vs giant cell
arteritis?}

\hypertarget{takayasu-arteritis}{%

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Involves aorta and major arch branches(Ehlert and Abularrage 2019a)
\item
  Young patients (20-40 years) and female in 80-90\% of cases, Asian
  populations
\item
  American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Criteria(Maz et al. 2021)

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \item
    Onset \textless40 years
  \item
    Claudication of an upper extremity
  \item
    Decreased brachial pulse
  \item
    \textgreater10 mmHg SBP between arms
  \item
    Bruit over subclavian arteries or aorta
  \item
    Arteriographic evidence of narrowing/occlusion in aorta/primary
    branches/or large upper/lower extremity arteries
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{giant-cell-arteritis}{%
\subsubsection{Giant cell arteritis}\label{giant-cell-arteritis}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Aorta and main branches, but predilection for carotid artery
  branches(Bongartz and Matteson 2006)
\item
  Diagnosis:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \item
    Age at disease onset \textgreater{} 50 years
  \item
    New headache
  \item
    Temporal artery abnormality
  \item
    Elevated ESR (\textgreater50) - can be normal in up to a quarter of
    cases.
  \item
    Abnormal (temporal) artery biopsy (gold standard test)
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Other symptoms include jaw pain with mastication or visual changes
\item
  Associated with Polymyalgia rheumatic, characterized by morning
  stiffness in shoulders/hips occurring in 40-50\% of patients.(Weyand
  and Goronzy 2014)
\item
  Arteriography/MRA/CTA/PET may be used to assess large vessel
  involvement - classic finding is smooth, tapering stenosis.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{management-5}{%
\subsubsection{Management}\label{management-5}}

\textbf{What is the medical treatment for GCA and when do you consider
surgical treatment?}

Medical-steroid therapy - In as many as 50\% of patients who have a
large vessel vasculitis refractory to glucocorticoid therapy alone,
patients will trial immunomodulators or cytotoxic trugs
(i.e.~methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate, tocilizumab, or
leflunomide)

Intervention - Avoid intervention in the acute setting. Once in
remission, treatment of symptomatic arterial lesions or those at
aneurysm size threshold should be considered and as many as 50-70\% with
large vessel vasculitis will require intervention.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Endovascular - angioplasty/stent/stent graft for large vessel
  vasculitis have all been described, however higher restenosis in
  endovascular compared to open treatment
\item
  Open Surgery (gold standard) - lesions are long, fibrotic and
  therefore less amenable to endovascular treatment. Bypass grafts from
  aorta-CCA are the most common (CEA should be avoid due to pathology
  involved)

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Upper extremity bypass with autogenous vein to the brachial artery
  \item
    Aortic aneurysms should be managed with open surgery(Janssen et al.
    2008)
  \item
    Mid aortic syndrome likely needs open repair from uninvolved
    aorta-usually thoracic aorta-to bifurcation bypass with jump graft
    to involved visceral vessels.(Ehlert and Abularrage 2019a)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{surveillance}{%
\subsubsection{Surveillance}\label{surveillance}}

\textbf{How should patients be monitored with active large artery
vasculitis?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Lab data tracked at least monthly for 6 months with close follow-up to
  ensure appropriate response to medical treatment and enable physicians
  to assess for adverse effects of medical treatment
\item
  Repeat tests after remission reached and imaging choice to evaluate
  large vessels (DUS/CTA/MRA)
\end{itemize}

Aneurysms}\label{subclavian-artery-aneurysms}}

\textbf{How are subclavian aneurysms caused and how can they present?}
(Baig and Timaran 2019)

\textbf{Etiology}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Degenerative - atherosclerotic or due to aberrant right subclavian
  with degenerative changes in proximal subclavian known as ``Kommerell
  diverticulum''(Tanaka, Milner, and Ota 2015)
\item
  Traumatic - blunt, penetrating, iatrogenic with attempted catheter
  placement
\item
  Radiation induced, sometimes seen after radiation for breast
  cancer.(Mohan et al. 2016)
\item
  Thoracic outlet obstruction - no need to investigate for aTOS if there
  is another plausible cause.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Presentation}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Rare, comprises 1\% of peripheral aneurysms.
\item
  Exam-pulsatile supraclavicular mass or bruit, absent/diminished
  pulses, signs of microembolization (``blue finger'')
\item
  Most discovered incidentally, however referred chest, neck, shoulder
  pain, upper extremity ischemia due to thrombosis or distal embolism,
  brachial plexus compression, hoarseness from right recurrent laryngeal
  nerve compression
\item
  Dysphagia from esophageal compression in aberrant right subclavian
  artery.(Tanaka, Milner, and Ota 2015)
\item
  Rarely rupture
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Evaluation}

\textbf{What are diagnostic studies and treatment modalities for
subclavian aneurysms?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  CXR-mediastinal mass may suggest neoplasm
\item
  MRA/CTA important to delineate extent of aneurysm and proximity to
  ipsilateral vertebral artery
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Management}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Open Repair-resection/endoaneurysmorrhaphy with end to end (small
  aneurysms) or interposition prosthetic graft(Vierhout et al. 2010)

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Proximal-median sternotomy with supraclavicular fossa extension for
    adequate proximal control for right side, however supraclavicular
    with left anterolateral thoracotomy for left subclavian aneurysm
  \item
    Mid-Distal-supraclavicular/infraclavicular generally adequate for
    control where again resection of the clavicle may be needed
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Endovascular Repair-transbrachial/transfemoral approach with covered
  stent(Maskanakis et al. 2018)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Must consider vertebral artery origin. Can cover vertebral artery if
    contralateral vertebral artery is patent and of adequate size,
    however posterior circulation stroke may occur when the
    contralateral vertebral artery is highly stenotic, hypoplastic or
    occluded.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Hybrid Repair-embolization/coils of proximal subclavian artery
  combined with subclavian transposition or carotid-subclavian bypass
\item
  For aberrant subclavian artery aneurysm, resection or exclusion of the
  aneurysmal artery with vascular reconstruction of the subclavian
  artery is recommended. Especially in the setting of dysphagia lusoria,
  subclavian artery reconstructed by interposition graft where proximal
  anastomosis is on ascending aorta. Alternatively, left posterolateral
  thoracotomy for proximal aneurysm resection and right supraclavicular
  incision for reconstruction of subclavian artery by end to side to the
  right CCA has been reported.(Tanaka, Milner, and Ota 2015)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Axillary Artery Aneurysms}\label{axillary-artery-aneurysms}}

\textbf{How are axillary aneurysms caused and how can they present?}

\textbf{Etiology}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Blunt/penetrating trauma
\item
  Congenital (infrequently reported)
\item
  Post-traumatic axillary aneurysms (repeated abduction/external
  rotation downward toward humeral head in baseball pitchers)

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Open Repair-resection with interposition vein grafting or prosthetic

\subsection{Brachial Artery Aneurysms}\label{brachial-artery-aneurysms}}

\textbf{How are brachial aneurysms caused and how can they present?}

\textbf{Etiology}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  False aneurysms secondary to repetitive trauma
\item
  Iatrogenic complications - Seen in 1-3\% of brachial artery access -
  increased risk in older age, female patients, and larger
  sheaths.(Treitl et al. 2015) More on appropriate access technique can
  be found in Chapter~\ref{sec-endovascular}
\item
  IV drug abuse - infected pseudoaneurysms in antecubital fossa.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Exam: pulsatile mass
\item
  Local pain or symptoms of median nerve compression
\item

\textbf{What are diagnostic studies and treatment modalities for
brachial aneurysms?}

\textbf{Evaluation}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Duplex Ultrasound
\item
  CTA/MRA of upper extremity may be needed to delineate extent of
  aneurysm
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Management}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Open Repair (preferred)-resection with patch or interposition vein
  grafting
\item
  Endovascular repair-rare and generally in a traumatic setting
\item
  Iatrogenic injuries-due to access and nonoperative treatment for
  small/asymptomatic pseudoaneurysms that are likely to thrombose
  spontaneously. Direct suture repair with evacuation of hematoma is
  possible. Thrombin injection is less favorable due to location and
  short neck.
\item
  Neurological symptoms from median nerve compression require an urgent
  repair, open surgery best for decompression.

Small pseudoaneurysms \textless3cm have a high rate of spontaneous
thrombosis. However, larger psuedoaneurysms or those with symptoms
require treatment. Often best managed with open excision and primary
repair or interposition graft.(Tosti et al. 2017)

\textbf{Presentation}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Various stages seen where early results in slight tingling/numbness
  and lateral, the tips of one or more fingers experience attacks of
  blanching that is usually precipitated by cold
\item
  Blanching typically lasts 1 hour and terminates with reactive

  Exposure to polyvinyl chloride can result in ischemic hand symptoms
  similar to those of Raynaud syndrome
\item
  Angiography-damage to digital arteries with multiple
  stenosis/occlusions or hyper vascularity adjacent to areas of bone
  resorption
\item
  Treatment-supportive
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Electrical burns}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textless1000 V cause injuries limited to immediate skin/soft tissue,
  however \textgreater1000 V cause damage from entry to exit point
\item
  Results in arterial necrosis with thrombus or bleeding and gangrene of
  digits develop
\item
  Initially can be occlusion/thrombosis or spasm, however later damage
  can cause aneurysmal degeneration
\item
  Treatment-dependent on soft tissue/bone injuries as well. Can have

Critically ill patients can be treated effectively with the use of a
closure device or covered stent placement.(Yoon et al. 2015; V. Tran et
al. 2009; Cohen et al. 2014) Cut down in the mid subclavian artery is
very difficult to perform and results in increased blood loss and worse
outcomes.

Trauma to the proximal subclavian should be accessed on R through a
median sternotomy or trapdoor incision. On the left, the proximal
subclavian is accessed best through an anterolateral thoracotomy.

\textbf{What is the mechanism and management of upper extremity axillary
artery trauma?}

\textbf{Etiology}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Predominantly in penetrating trauma with equal incidence in
  proximal/middle/distal divisions and brachial plexus injury in
  \textgreater1/3rd of arterial injury
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Evaluation}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Physical exam with deficiencies in upper extremity pulses/ischemic
  changes, but may not be present given collateral flow from axillary
  artery to upper extremity
\item
  High index of suspicion with location of injury proximity to course of
  axillary artery
\item
  Upper extremity Doppler or CTA if patient is stable for diagnosis
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Management}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Primary repair or treated with interposition graft
\item
  If hemodynamically stable, can consider covered stent based on
  location to thoracic outlet via femoral/brachial approach. Discussed

\subsection{Demographics}\label{demographics-2}}

Thoracic Outlet Syndrome (TOS) is a constellation of signs and symptoms
relating to the compression of the neurovascular structures that occurs
as these structures travel between the thoracic aperture and the upper
limb.

Types: Neurogenic, Venous and Arterial

\begin{itemize}
\item
  vTOS -- 2-3\%
\item
  aTOS -- 1\%
\item
  nTOS -- \textgreater95\% (Humphries and Freischlag 2019b)
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{anatomy-1}{%
\subsubsection{Anatomy}\label{anatomy-1}}

Understanding the anatomy of what is collectively referred to as the
thoracic outlet is the best way to thoroughly appreciate this topic.

\ul{Anatomy from anterior to posterior}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Subclavian vein
\item
  Phrenic nerve
\item
  Anterior scalene muscle attachment to the first rib
\item
  The subclavian artery
\item
  The brachial plexus
\item
  The middle scalene muscle
\end{enumerate}

\ul{Three spaces where the neurovascular structures are at risk of
compression}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Interscalene Triangle -} Appreciating the attachments of the
  Anterior and Middle Scalene Muscles on the first rib becomes important
  in the diagnosis of the various types and also the ultimate surgical
  management of the compression.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \textbf{Anterior Scalene -} Attachments: Anterior Tubercles of the
    four `typical' cervical vertebrae (3-6) AND the scalene tubercle on
    the upper surface of the first rib.

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Phrenic nerve runs along anterior scalene muscle and injury can
      cause ipsilateral diaphragm paralysis.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    \textbf{Middle Scalene -} Attachments: The posterior tubercles and
    intertubercular lamellae of all the cervical vertebrae AND the
    Quadrangular area between the neck and subclavian groove of the
    first rib. (McMinn 2019)

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Long thoracic nerve runs along middle scalene muscle and injury
      can cause winged scapula.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    \textbf{The First Rib -} The broadest and flattest of the ribs and
    is an `Atypical Rib' because it only one articular facet.

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      The upper surface of the first rib has the scalene and
      quadrangular tubercles for attachments of the anterior and middle
      scalene muscles respectively. There are also three grooves for the
      Subclavian Vein, artery and the Lower Trunk of the Brachial
      Plexus.
    \item
      The Inferior Surface is smooth and inferior and medially has an
      attachment for the suprapleural membrane, Sibson's fascia AKA
      scalenus minimus muscle, which is tethered to the C7 vertebrae.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Costoclavicular Passage -} This is the passage of the
  subclavian vein largely as it emerges through the tight space created
  by the clavicle, the subclavius muscle and the costoclavicular
  ligament and also more posteriorly this can also compress the artery
  and nerves as the space can also be narrow in relation with the
  scapula and subscapularis. (Gary G Wind and R. James Valentine 2013)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \textbf{Subclavius Muscle -} Attached to the costochondral junction
    of the first rib and is inserted into the subclavian groove on the
    inferior surface of the clavicle. (McMinn 2019)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Subcoracoid Space -} This space is best appreciated by
  intimate knowledge of three things(Gary G Wind and R. James Valentine
  2013)

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \item
    \textbf{The Coracoid Process}

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Arising from the Scapula as a `process', this broad-based bony
      landmark offers attachment to muscles and ligaments.
    \item
      The relevant attachments being the pectoralis minor muscle
      occupying the medial border for about 2cm behind its tip. The tip
      itself having a medial and lateral facet for the short head of
      biceps and the coracobrachialis muscles respectively.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    \textbf{Pectoralis Minor Muscle:}

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Attached to the bone of the third, fourth and fifth ribs AND the
      medial border of the coracoid process.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    \textbf{Clavipectoral Fascia:}

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      A sheet of fascial membrane that fills the space between the
      clavicle and pectoralis minor splitting and encompassing the
      subclavius muscle. Its superior portion is what can be thickened
      and become a tight band referred to as the costocoracoid ligament.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Anomalous Anatomy}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Phrenic Nerve Anomaly -} The phrenic nerve normally runs
  anterior to the Subclavian Vein. A rare anomaly is the nerve
  compressing the vein anteriorly and in very rare circumstances due to
  the timing of development can run through the vein itself.
\item
  \textbf{Cervical Rib -} Anomalous anatomy can also cause TOS
  especially when patients have a Cervical Rib and anomalous first ribs
  or a congenital band attaching to the first rib.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Incidence of anomalous first ribs and cervical ribs is 0.76\% and
    0.75\% respectively.
  \item
    Incidence of bands are as high as 63\% in the general population.

\subsubsection{Clinical Examination}\label{clinical-examination}}

Provocative maneuvers are largely used for nTOS. While these are
described and mentioned in most texts their utility largely is beyond
the scope of a vascular surgeon's assessment and diagnosis of nTOS.

\textbf{Adson Test}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Extended abducted and externally rotated arm -- palpate radial pulse
\item
  Rotate and laterally flex the neck to the ipsilateral side while
  inhaling deeply.
\item
  A positive test results in reduction or complete obliteration of
  radial pulse
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Roos Test / EAST test}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Patient seated and both arms abducted 90 degrees and externally
  rotated and elbows flexed at 90 degrees.
\item
  Open and close hands for 3 minutes or until pain or paraesthesia sets
  in.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Elveys Test}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Abduct both arms to 90 degrees with elbows extended and dorsiflex both
  wrists.
\item
  If pain is elicited as wrists dorsiflexed then test is positive.
\item
  A further maneuver is then performed, laterally flex the head on each
  side, if pain is elicited on the contralateral side to which the head
  is flexed then test is positive. (Humphries and Freischlag 2019b)

  compression
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Angiography}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item

\end{itemize}

\textbf{Other studies}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Electromyography and nerve conduction studies for nTOS - performed
  after evaluation with neurologist and physiotherapist.

\hypertarget{management-7}{%
\subsection{Management}\label{management-7}}

After the appropriate evaluation, if decompression of thoracic outlet is
deemed appropriate, there are multiple approaches to the first rib
resections.

\textbf{Transaxillary}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Advantages:}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Cosmetically more appealing as it has a limited hidden scar
  \item
    Allows for removal of a significant portion of the rib anteriorly
    and posteriorly
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Disadvantages:}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Difficult to visualize the anatomy, dependent on good assistance
  \item
    Risk of injury to T1 nerve root, phrenic nerve, long thoracic,
    brachial plexus , subclavian vein and arterial with limited exposure
    to repair
  \item
    Not able to approach cervical ribs, scalene triangle or patch vein.
  \end{itemize}

\textbf{Supraclavicular}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Advantages}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Good for scalene triangle access and debulking and cervical rib
    resection
  \item
    Required for aTOS if arterial reconstruction necessary
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Disadvantages}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Unable to decompress venous compression or visualize vein adequately
  \item
    Cosmetically less appealing

\textbf{Infraclavicular}(Siracuse et al. 2015)

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Advantages}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Good access for venous decompression
  \item
    Allows for excision of subclavius muscle and costoclavicular
    ligament
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Disadvantages}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Unable to expose subclavian artery or decompress brachial plexus.
  \item
    Difficult to access most posterior aspect of rib
  \item
    Cosmetically less appealing
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Paraclavicular}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Advantages}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Useful if mixed etiology TOS to adequately decompression all
    neurovascular structures
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Disadvantages}

  \begin{itemize}

  \item
    Requires two incisions one above and below the clavicle

  Post operative patients with hemodynamic instability and ipsilateral
  effusion on xray should go back to OR for exploration and hemorrhage
  control. (Rinehardt, Scarborough, and Bennett 2017)
\item
  Chyle leak often managed with adequate drainage and medium chain fatty
  acid diet. Persistent leak should undergo wound exploration and
  ligation of thoracic duct (most often encountered on the left) or VATS
  thoracic duct ligation.(Delaney et al. 2017) IR embolization has also
  been shown to be effective.(Cope, Salem, and Kaiser 1999)

  \textbf{Paget Schroetter Syndrome}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    First defined by Hughes in 1949 in reference to Sir James Paget who
    in a hundred years earlier defined acute arm swelling and pain as
    possibly related to vasospasm and then von Schroetter who in 1884
    attributed to the presentation to subclavian and axillary vein
    thrombosis. (Humphries and Freischlag 2019a)
  \item
    Now vTOS and Paget Schroetter Syndrome are synonymous.
  \item
    Paget Schroetter Syndrome accounts for 10-20\% of all upper
    extremity deep vein thrombosis. (Sekhar 2018)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{presentation-2}{%

\item
  Pain on exertion of the upper limb described as stabbing, aching or
  tightness.
\item
  The reported incidence of PE following upper limb DVT is
  \textless12\%. (Humphries and Freischlag 2019a)
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{evaluation-4}{%
\subsection{Evaluation}\label{evaluation-4}}

Upper extremity venogram is a very useful modality for diagnosis.
Compression likely will not be seen in normal orientation, however can
be demonstrated with provocative maneuvers including 90 degree arm
abduction and external rotation.(Moriarty et al. 2015)

\begin{itemize}
\item
  A differential diagnosis for Upper Limb DVT

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    vTOS
  \item
    Congenital Phrenic Nerve anomaly
  \item
    History of fracture, clavicular fracture and malunion
  \item
    Repetitive arm provocative maneuvers, check occupation and history
    of body-building

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Pectoralis Minor Hypertrophy.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Exclude Pulmonary Embolism
\item
  Exclude Venous Gangrene and Phlegmasia of the upper limb
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{management-8}{%
\subsection{Management}\label{management-8}}

Limited evidence due to lack of RCT's. Majority of evidence based on
retrospective studies.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Prevent immediate risk
\item
  Return patient to unrestricted use of the affected extremity
\item
  Prevent recurrence of thrombosis without the need of long-term
  anticoagulation
\item
  Prevent long term Post Phlebitic Limb Syndrome
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{medical-management}{%
\subsubsection{Medical Management}\label{medical-management}}

As per ACCP Guidelines: Initial management is anticoagulation regardless
of etiology. (Kearon, Akl, Ornelas, Blaivas, Jimenez, Bounameaux,
Huisman, King, Morris, Sood, Stevens, et al. 2016)

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The limitations of anticoagulation alone are that the slow
  recanalization of the thrombus may lead to eventual valvular damage
  and intravenous scarring. (Sekhar 2018)
\end{itemize}

Catheter Directed Thrombolysis (CDT) has been considered superior to
anticoagulation alone in minimizing valvular damage due to residual clot
and carries a lower risk of intracranial hemorrhage.(Urschel and Patel
2008)

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Systemic Lysis -- non favored due to risk of intracranial hemorrhage.
  (Grunwald and Hofmann 2004)
\item
  Optimal timing of CDT - Within 14 days of onset of thrombosis.
  Excellent results have been reported following CDT if initiated before
  14 days. (J. J. Wilson, Zahn, and Newman 1990)
\end{itemize}

Patient should be maintained in a compression sleeve until definitive
decompression can be performed.

\hypertarget{surgery}{%
\subsubsection{Surgery}\label{surgery}}

After initial management patients are generally divided into two groups,
unsuccessful or successful thrombolysis.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Persistent stenosis or signs of extrinsic compression, on venography,
  has generally been perceived as a significant risk of recurrent
  thrombosis.
\end{itemize}

Surgery for vTOS remains to be mainly Rib Resection and decompression of
the subclavian vein with or without venolysis and patch plasty either
surgical or endovenous.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Surgical treatment of severe resistant subclavian vein stenosis in the
  setting of vTOS is rib resection by paraclavicular approach and vein
  patch plasty. (Melby et al. 2008)
\end{itemize}

Venous occlusion in vTOS may be treated with jugular turn down or venous
bypass to IJ of SVC if patients remain symptomatic. (Vemuri et al. 2016)

\hypertarget{summary}{%
\subsection{Summary}\label{summary}}

\hypertarget{controversy}{%
\subsubsection{Controversy}\label{controversy}}

There is a lack of consensus around the necessity of surgical rib
resection, the timing and the requirement for vein patch plasty. Options
post recanalization:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Deferring surgical decompression for 1-3 months after thrombolysis to
  allow for healing of the venous endothelium and resolution of the
  acute inflammatory process. (Humphries and Freischlag 2019a)
\item
  Decompression during the same admission, as the thrombolysis, with the
  main benefit being to reduce the risk of re-occlusion. (Humphries and
  Freischlag 2019a; Molina, Hunter, and Dietz 2007)
\item
  Post decompression venography and treatment 2 weeks post rib resection
  may help to prevent recurrence and long term vein patency. (K. Z.
  Chang et al. 2012)

Most useful studies are pulse volume recordings (PVR) and duplex to

\hypertarget{management-9}{%
\subsection{Management}\label{management-9}}

Symptomatic patients are generally indicated for treatment. Unlike
asymptomatic patients in whom it may be appropriate to manage
conservatively. (Boll and Valentine 2019) Symptoms are classified
according the the Scher staging system.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Scher Staging of aTOS}(Scher et al. 1984)

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Stage 0: Asymptomatic
  \item
    Stage 1: Stenosis of Subclavian Artery with minor post stenotic
    dilatation with no intimal disruption
  \item
    Stage 2: Subclavian artery aneurysm with intimal damage and mural
    thrombus
  \item
    Stage 3: Distal embolisation from subclavian artery disease
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Supraclavicular rib resection is the most suitable for adequate arterial
reconstruction. Transaxillary has been argued to offer more complete rib
resection however arterial repair is not possible in this approach.

Subclavian artery repair is necessary in Scher Stages 2 and 3 and in
some cases 1. Arterial repair with conduit either GSV, Femoral Vein or
prosthetic have been described. Ringed PTFE offers good patency and
resistance to kinking in this functional anatomical location.

\hypertarget{management-10}{%
\subsection{Management}\label{management-10}}

As the patient has already seen multiple specialists and
physiotherapists, the role of the vascular surgeon with nTOS is often
limited but should focus on:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Exclude other causes
\item
  Confirm diagnosis -- Neurophysiologic Tests (EMG and NCS)
\item
  Seek alternate opinion
\item
  Trial of Physiotherapy and non-operative management - patients should
  be evaluated and undergo a 6 week course of physical therapy. This
  physical therapy focuses on scalene and pectoralis stretching
  improving mobility of the shoulder and strengthening the arm. Many
  improve with physical therapy. (Balderman et al. 2019)
\item
  Anterior scalene lidocaine block may provide temporary symptom relief
  (\textasciitilde7 days) and may help identify those patients most
  likely to benefit from surgical decompression. (Salhan et al. 2016;
  Lum, Brooke, Likes, et al. 2012)
\item
  Botulinum injection may give an average of 6 weeks of relief. (Salhan
  et al. 2016)
\item
  Be selective in patients who may require surgery
\end{itemize}

Surgery with Rib resection often is accomplished with transaxillary or
supraclavicular approach, particularly if scalenectomy or cervical rib
resection is necessary.

\section{Planning access creation}\label{planning-access-creation}}

Management of Dialysis access is an important topic of discussion, not
only because it is a significant part of board examinations, but also
because healthcare costs continue to rise for ESRD patients,
particularly during the transition from CKD to ESRD. This is attributed
to use of dialysis catheters and frequent hospitalizations for
arteriovenous access failures and related procedures.

The National Kidney Foundation-Dialysis Outcomes Quality Initiative
(NKF-KDOQI) and SVS has provided guidelines in the follow
areas:(Foundation 2015; Sidawy et al. 2008)

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Timing of referral to access surgeons
\item
  Operative strategies to maximize placement of autogenous AV accesses
\item
  First choice for autogenous access
\item
  Choice of AV access when a patient is not a suitable candidate for a
  forearm autogenous access
\item
  The role of monitoring and surveillance of AV access management
\item
  Conversion of a prosthetic AV access to a secondary autogenous AV
  access
\item
  Management of nonfunctional or failed AV access
\end{itemize}

\textbf{This brings us to the question, who needs dialysis access?}

Patients should be referred to a vascular surgeon for access when their
creatinine clearance is \textless25mL/min which is CKD stage 4. You want
to provide adequate time for your autogenous access to mature, so the
ideal time for access creation would be \textgreater{} 6 months before
anticipated need of dialysis. This allows for time for any subsequent
interventions if your access is not maturing.

\textbf{Should prosthetic access also be placed several months before
anticipated dialysis?}

Prosthetic access patency is limited by duration of access placement,
thus, if a patient requires prosthetic access, placement should be
delayed until about 3-6 weeks before initiation of dialysis.(Foundation
2015)

\textbf{For dialysis access creation, which site should be considered
and used first?}

Due to the easier accessibility and lower infection rates, upper
extremity access sites are used first. Furthermore, you want to place
your access as far distally in the extremity as possible to preserve the
proximal arm for future accesses.

\textbf{What are some important considerations in a patient's history
when planning a dialysis access?}

It is important to find out recent history of:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Previous access procedures
\item
  Peripheral IV lines
\item
  Sites of any existing or previous indwelling catheters including
  pacemakers and defibrillators
\item
  Trauma or surgery to the upper extremities
\end{itemize}

Moreover, you also want to consider the patient's quality of life, thus,
noting which extremity is dominant is important. If possible, you want
to create your dialysis access in the non-dominant arm so that when the
patient is receiving dialysis multiple times a week, they are able to
use their dominant arm during their dialysis sessions.

However, placing a fistula with lowest rate of failure is preferred to
using non-dominant hand. Therefore, placement of access on the patients
dominant side would be preferred over placement of access with high risk
of failure (i.e.~on the side of an implantable cardiac device).(Sgroi et
al. 2019)

\textbf{As with any preoperative planning, physical examination is
extremely important. Central venous stenosis can cause problems such as
prolonged bleeding after dialysis sessions at the puncture site. What
are some signs of central venous stenosis?}

Unilateral arm swelling or edema and prominent venous collaterals are
signs of central venous stenosis. Central venous stenosis can lead to
venous hypertension which affects access patency and function, and also
causes disabling edema. Placement of AV access in a patient with
undiagnosed SVC stenosis or obstruction can cause SVC syndrome.(Kalra,
Bjarnason, and Gloviczki 2019)

Beyond signs of central venous stenosis, when examining a patient, an
Allen's test should always be performed to evaluate palmar arch patency.

\textbf{Preoperative planning should also include arterial and venous
assessments. What are your size requirements for the artery and the vein
to be used in your dialysis access creation?}

First, you want equal pressure gradients in bilateral upper extremities.
If there is a pressure differential \textgreater20mmHg or pulses are
non-palpable then patients should undergo a duplex ultrasound to
evaluate for arterial insufficiency and and the artery should be greater
than or equal to 2mm. Segmental pressures have limited applicability.
Patients with correctable lesions on duplex may consider undergoing
angiography and intervention to optimize inflow.(Sidawy et al. 2008)

A venous duplex should also be done to evaluate for diameter,
distensibility and continuity. A vein mapping is useful to determine the
size of the patient's superficial veins at various points in the forearm
and upper arm. The vein should ideally be at least 3mm, but 2.5mm will
likely dilate after regional anesthesia and be sufficient for access
particularly in smaller patients.(Huber et al. 2002; Smith, Gohil, and
Chetter 2012)

\textbf{Autogenous access should always be considered first due to
higher patency rates, lower infection rates, and longer duration of
access survival. What are the different configurations of autogenous
accesses?}

The first and best option would be direct arteriovenous anastomosis.
However, if that is not possible, then venous transposition should be
considered next follow by venous translocation.

Venous transposition is for deeper veins such as the basilic vein, which
is transposed so the vein lies just below the skin for easier access for
puncture during dialysis sessions. This can be done in either a
one-stage or two-stage procedure. In a 2-stage procedure, the direct
arteriovenous anastomosis is created during the first stage and once the
vein has arterialized 4-6 weeks later, the second stage of transposition
is done when the vein is easier to mobilize. Translocation procedures
include harvesting the femoral or saphenous vein and using it as a
conduit for AV access creation in the upper extremity.

\textbf{When can a venous transposition be done in a one stage
procedure?}

Many surgeons will do a brachiobasilic arteriovenous fistula creation
with the transposition in one-stage. However, if the vein is
\textless4mm, it is generally recommended to do a two-stage procedure so
that if the fistula fails to mature, the patient does not have to
undergo a second operation with extensive dissection of the vein. When a
patient has not been initiated on dialysis and there is marginal vein
that would require transposition, but carry a significant risk of graft
failure then a first-stage BB fistula may be appropriate.

When comparing single- to two-stage brachiobasilic fistula, two-stage
creation had high rates of primary patency at 2-years. However, there
was no difference in infection rate, steal syndrome, hematoma,
pseudoaneurysm, stenosis, failure rate, primary or secondary patency at
1-year or secondary patency at 2-years.(Jun Yan Wee et al. 2018)

\textbf{It was mentioned earlier that the dialysis access should be
created as distally as possible on the extremity. What are some of the
most distal locations?}

The snuffbox fistula, which is the posterior radial branch to cephalic
direct access and Brescia-Cimino-Appell (often shortened to just Cimino)
fistula which is the radial-cephalic wrist direct access are two of the
most distal fistulas that can be created. Overall, these have comparable
patency and ischemia risk. While snuff box fistulas carry a 10\% failure
rate at 1mo, the majority are able to be converted to RC
fistulas.(Siracuse et al. 2019)

episode on the history of AV Access} where we interview Dr.~Kenneth
Appell, one of the surgeons who pioneered this surgical technique.

\end{tcolorbox}

\textbf{What are your arterial and venous options in the upper
extremity?}

In the forearm, you have your radial, ulnar, and brachial arteries and
cephalic and basilic veins. In the upper arm, you have your brachial or
proximal radial arteries and cephalic, basilic, brachial and axillary
veins.

If adequate vein is available, most common access sites distal to
proximal include:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Snuff box
\item
  Radiocephalic
\item
  Basilic transposition in forearm
\item
  Brachiocephalic fistula - these have a few advantages over more distal
  fistulas, including higher maturation rates, decreased time to
  maturity, higher patency and functional primary patency.(Nguyen et al.
  2007)
\item
  Brachiobasilic fistula(Gilmore 2006)
\item
  Vein transposition from a remote site - Femoral vein transposition can
  be used for upper extremity dialysis access in patients with previous
  upper extremity access complicated by infection, thus not a candidate
  for prosthetic, but no central stenosis. There is a high rate of hand
  ischemia due to larger conduit (up to 43\%).(Huber et al. 2004)
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{If you need to use a prosthetic graft, what would you use?}

PTFE is the most commonly used prosthetic graft. Either a 6mm graft or a
tapered 4-7mm graft can be used. The tapered grafts help to ensure that
the size of your arterial anastomosis isn't too large to minimize
chances of steal. However, recent publications found that there is no
difference between tapered and non-tapered grafts in terms of primary
patency, steal syndrome, complication rates or need for
reintervention.(Roberts et al. 2019; Han, Seo, and Ryu 2017) Both the
6mm PTFE graft and the tapered 4-7mm PTFE grafts are standard sizes used
for dialysis access creation.

Overall AVG have benefit of earlier cannulation, however they have lower
patency rates and higher infection rates. There is no difference between
grafts and fistulas for perioperative morbidity and mortality.(Macsata
and Sidawy 2019)

Most prosthetic access will fail because of the development of venous
outflow stenosis as a result of smooth muscle proliferation at vein
graft interface. Thus, a major cause of graft failure is due to
thrombosis. Heparin-bonded PTFE (HB-PTFE) grafts are an option, however,
studies have shown no improvement in graft patency with HB-PTFE compared
to standard PTFE grafts.(Shemesh et al. 2015; Davies, Anaya-Ayala, and
El-Sayed 2016)

There are also early cannulation prosthetic grafts, which is another
option for patients who need more immediate dialysis access. These
grafts are constructed in 3 layers with an elastomeric membrane in the
middle between two layers of ePTFE material. This allows for cannulation
as early as 24 hours from implantation because the graft configuration
minimizes dialysis needle bleeding. This graft options allows for
avoidance of a central venous catheter. Studies have shown similar
patency rates compared to standard ePTFE, earlier cannulation and
catheter removal, and decreased catheter related complications.(Julien
Al Shakarchi and Inston 2019; J. K. Wagner et al. 2019)

\textbf{For patients with central venous stenosis or occlusion, what is
another alternative upper extremity access creation?}

Two overall strategies for managing patients with severe central venous
stenosis or occlusion are lower extremity AV access of hybrid
catheter/grafts. Patency of femoral vein transposition is better than
hybrid catheter/graft placement.(Brownie 2016; Glickman 2011) We will
cover specifics of these techniques later.

For lower extremity AV access, femoral vein transposition has been shown
to have the best outcomes, followed by saphenous vein transposition and
graft placement. Lower extremity access should be avoided in patients
with peripheral vascular disease or lower extremity ischemic
symptoms--when in doubt perform duplex and segmental pressures to fully
evaluate. Veins should also be evaluated to ensure patency more
proximally.(Parekh, Niyyar, and Vachharajani 2016)

For patients where lower extremity access may not be appropriate, the
hemodialysis reliable outflow (HeRO) device can come to the rescue.
These devices may not have been encountered in your training, so we will
go into detail here. This device is composed of 2 components: a graft
which is made of 6mm PTFE with a titanium coupler at one end, and a
venous outflow component of a 19 Fr silicone catheter reinforced with a
nitinol braid to prevent kinking. The graft portion is anastomosed to an
artery, usually brachial, and is tunneled subcutaneously and the venous
component is percutaneously placed into the right atrium via the IJ or
subclavian vein. The two components are connected with a titanium
coupler at the deltopectoral groove. If you need more immediate
dialysis, the super HeRO comes to the rescue in which the graft portion
is the early cannulation graft.

For patients with thoracic central venous occlusion, there is also the
SURFACER inside-out access catheter system. This is a device used to
cross central occlusions from the right femoral vein. It allows
placement of a tunneled central venous catheter, but it can also be
utilized as an adjunct for HeRO placement. In a multicenter study, the
results from the SAVE (Surfacer System to Facilitate Access in Venous
Obstructions) registry showed that in 29 or 30 patients with thoracic
central venous occlusion, a central venous catheter was successfully
placed. Moreover, there were no device-related adverse events, catheter
malposition, or intra- or postprocedural complications. (Gallieni et al.
2020)

Hybrid catheter/grafts are good alternatives in patients with previous
line infections, central stenosis, peripheral vascular disease and no
suitable vein in the upper extremities. They have shown fewer bacteremia
episodes than catheter, low primary patency rate and acceptable
secondary patency rates.(J. Al Shakarchi et al. 2015) Absolute
contraindications include donor artery \textless3mm, inability to dilate
outflow vein to 19f, allergy to device materials (ePTFE, silicone,
titanium, nitinol), and current active infection.(Medical, n.d.)

\hypertarget{techniques-for-access-creation}{%
\section{Techniques for access
creation}\label{techniques-for-access-creation}}

\textbf{The techniques of arteriovenous fistula creation are common
across access sites. Can you go through the techniques?}

First the vein is identified and the distal end is transected and
flushed with heparin. By flushing with the heparin, you are able to
access the caliber and extent of the vein as well as identify any side
branches

Then after distal and proximal control of your artery, a 4-6mm
arteriotomy is made. The length is limited to decrease incidence of
arterial steal. The artery is then flushed with heparin to avoid
thrombosis during the anastomosis and an anastomosis is created between
the side of the artery and the end of the vein. A 6-0 or 7-0
nonabsorbable continuous suture should be used to create the anastomosis
to avoid future dilation of the anastomosis.

For prosthetic accesses, the length of the arteriotomy does not have to
be limited to 4 to 6mm since the incidence of arterial steal is limited
by the graft diameter. Both arterial inflow and venous outflow vessels
need to be dissected prior to graft anastomoses. The graft should be
tunneled close to the surface of the skin to allow for easier
cannulation. Meticulous attention to sterile technique is important to
avoid graft infections. And as with the fistula creations, a 6-0 or 7-0
nonabsorbable continuous suture should be used to create the anastomosis
to avoid future dilation of the anastomosis.

episode on the basics of AV Access placement}.

\end{tcolorbox}

\textbf{What are some other options if an access is not able to be
created in the upper extremity?}

Autogenous accesses can also be created in the lower extremity. Femoral
artery to femoral vein or saphenous vein anastomosis can be created.
Both veins have to be transposed. Synthetic grafts have high infection
rates (as high as 22\% in some series) and only a 50\% patency at 6
months.(G. A. Antoniou et al. 2009; Lazarides et al. 2018; Pike et al.
2019) Risk of lower extremity ischemia increased with burden of PVD, AV
fistula vs graft, distal arterial inflow, and large femoral vein
mismatch, but can be tempered by banding/narrowing of femoral vein at
the time of surgery.(G. A. Antoniou et al. 2009; Bourquelot et al. 2012;
Gradman, Laub, and Cohen 2005)

Access creation in the chest wall or cervical region is also possible
with axillary artery to ipsilateral axillary vein loop access, axillary
artery to contralateral axillary or jugular vein straight access (ie
necklace access) and brachial artery to jugular vein straight access.
Keep in mind that for these fistulas, the central veins must be patent.

\hypertarget{anesthetic-considerations}{%
\subsection{Anesthetic Considerations}\label{anesthetic-considerations}}

\textbf{Are there benefits to different anesthetic techniques used
during access placement, such as regional anesthesia?}

Regional anesthesia for AVF creation has been associated with higher
perioerative flow and lower rates of vasospasm resulting in higher rates
of short term patency. Regional anesthesia has not been associated with
perioperative rates of major morbidity or mortality.(Aitken et al. 2016;
Siracuse et al. 2014)

Due to underlying comorbidities, it is often best to avoid general
anesthesia in these patients. Many access procedures can be performed
under regional or straight local anesthetic. There, it is very important
to understand the pharmacokinetics and maximum doses of common local
anesthetics.(Neal et al. 2018) Historically, it has been taught that the
inclusion of epinephrine allows for higher dosages, but more recent
reports do not include this adjustment.(Sztajnkrycer 2019) Common local
anesthetics include:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Bupivacaine - Long acting. Max SubQ Dose is 2mg/kg.
\item
  Lidocaine - Medium acting. Max SubQ Dose is 4.5 mg/kg.
\item
  Mepivacaine - Medium acting. Max SubQ Dose is 4.4 mg/kg.
\item
  Ropivacaine - Long acting. Max SubQ Dose is 3 mg/kg.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{endovascular-av-fistula}{%
\subsection{Endovascular AV Fistula}\label{endovascular-av-fistula}}

\textbf{What is the role for endovascular creation of AV fistula?}

Endovascular approach to fistula creation without open surgery is
another option for dialysis access creation. The results of the NEAT
study (Novel Endovacular Access Trial), prospective multicenter study
which showed that 98\% of the 80 patients enrolled had EndoAVFs created.
Of these, 87\% were physiologically suited for dialysis, and functional
usability (2 needle cannulation) was 64\%. Primary patency was 69\% and
and cumulative patency was 84\%. Total complication rate was 8\% and
this is a promising alternative to surgical arteriovenous fistula
creations. (Lok et al. 2017)

\hypertarget{maintenance-and-complications}{%
\section{Maintenance and
complications}\label{maintenance-and-complications}}

\textbf{When is the newly created dialysis access ready for use?}

A good way to remember this is the rule of 6's. Fistulas should be
created about 6 months prior to start of hemodialysis. It is ready to
use when the fistula is 6mm in diameter, has a flow of 600ml/min, is 6mm
from the surface of the skin and usually takes 6 weeks to mature.

Prosthetic AV accesses can be used as early as 2 weeks postoperatively.
If you use the 3-layer early cannulation grafts, the access can be used
as early as 24 hours after access creation. This is great because it
offers the potential for avoidance of dialysis catheters in patients who
need dialysis immediately.(Glickman et al. 2015)

\hypertarget{failure-to-mature}{%
\subsection{Failure to mature}\label{failure-to-mature}}

\textbf{What are some reasons why an access may fail to mature?}

Sometimes your access may have arterial inflow stenosis. This is
difficult to detect clinically because there will be a palpable thrill,
however, due to the stenosis, the flow is not sufficient enough for
dialysis. Dialysis access duplex is a useful way to assess flow volumes
and identify areas of stenosis that could be further assessed with
fistulogram. In the absence of arterial inflow issues, collateral or
large venous branches can divert blood away from the main access channel
resulting in insufficient flow. This can be resolved by coiling or
ligating the large venous branches that limit maturation of the fistula.

\textbf{If the newly created AV fistula is not maturing, what are some
secondary procedures to help with maturation?}

First a duplex ultrasound can help to identify whether this is an
inflow, outflow, or conduit issue. Once the likely source of the issue
is identified, then there are multiple open or endovascular techniques
to assist maturation.

Endovascular procedures include arterial and venous angioplasties to
improve inflow or outflow issues.(Sidawy et al. 2008) In particular,
balloon assisted maturation (BAM) has been described to decrease
maturation time. A prospective randomized controlled study by Elkassaby
et al.~showed that BAM significantly decreased maturation time and had
higher successful functional maturation. However, BAM was also shown to
have increased fistula complication rates.(Elkassaby et al. 2021) Open
procedures include vein patches, interposition vein grafts, vein
transposition to proximal arteries, branch ligations, and vein
superficialization.

\hypertarget{access-failure}{%
\subsection{Access Failure}\label{access-failure}}

\textbf{Once a dialysis access is created, maintenance of the access is
extremely important. The flow disturbances and hemodynamic changes
associated with AV access creation causes intimal hyperplasia leading to
venous outflow stenosis. This can ultimately lead to access thrombosis
and failure. What are some methods of detecting access failure?}

One way of detecting a well functioning access is a strong thrill at the
arterial anastomosis which continues a few centimeters into the outflow
vein. If you feel a pulsation near the venous outflow, then a stenosis
or thrombosis is likely. If you feel a thrill distal to the area of
pulsation, then you have likely localized your area of stenosis. It is
important to note that you may feel a pulsation at a pseudoaneurysm
independent of venous outflow issues.

Other signs of outflow stenosis are collateral veins or upper extremity
edema.(Padberg, Calligaro, and Sidawy 2008) This is indicative of venous
hypertension likely secondary to stenosis. You will typically see this
in the shoulder area or anterior chest as a results of subclavian vein
stenosis/thrombosis. Moreover, these high venous pressures as a result
of the stenosis can result in excessive and prolonged bleeding after
removal of needles from the dialysis puncture sites. This is often the
first sign of elevated venous pressures. These patients should undergo a
fistulogram to evaluate for underlying outflow stenosis.(Caro Monroig et
al. 2018) Sometimes, a hematoma from dialysis access cannulation can
result in compression of the fistula. In these cases, the hematoma
should be drained to relieve the compression.

The most common cause of graft failure in upper extremity fistulas is
venous outflow stenosis and in grafts is venous anastomotic intimal
hyperplasia.(Berman and Gentile 2001; Padberg, Calligaro, and Sidawy
2008) Diagnostic fistulogram is a very useful tool to diagnose and treat
potential access complications. Diagnostic fistulogram is often
performed with proximal access of the fistula a few centimeters distal
to the anastomosis. Compression of venous outflow is necessary to
evaluate for inflow and anastomotic issues.(Bountouris et al. 2018)

Finally, even patients with normal physical exam can have issues while
on the hemodialysis circuit, such as recirculation. When in doubt, if
there are recurrent issues with hemodialysis, the patient should undergo
a fistulogram to evaluate for occult venous outflow stenosis that may be
missed on other diagnostic modalities.(Sidawy et al. 2008)

\textbf{What are some endovascular interventions for a failing access?}

First line therapy for outflow stenosis is a simple balloon angioplasty
of the stenosed area.(Berman and Gentile 2001) Insufflation times are
generally up to 2-3 minutes. Treatment of stenosis 2/2 intimal
hyperplasia often require high pressures of 20 ATM or more. However,
this is a double edge sword because this can lead to trauma in the veins
stimulating a further intimal hyperplasia process. Some advocate a
cutting balloon before high pressure dilation. There are also studies
showing improved primary patency with drug coated balloons with no
difference in survival compared to plain angioplasty.(Han, Seo, and Ryu
2017; X. Chen et al. 2020; Moreno-Sánchez et al. 2020; Yin et al. 2021)
Stenting is also an option to treat residual stenosis or dissections
after balloon angioplasty. Covered stents have shown good patency
results.

Some unique situations include, recurrent cephalic arch stenosis which
may be best treated with bare metal stenting.(Shemesh et al. 2008)
Proximal occlusions (i.e.~subclavian) may be best treated primarily with
a covered stent.(Agarwal 2015; Anaya-Ayala et al. 2011)

\textbf{If endovascular interventions fail, what are some open options
for managing a failing access?}

Generally an interposition graft or patch angioplasty is performed and
the results of the two techniques are largely equivalent.

\textbf{If an AV access has ultimately failed and thrombosed, what are
your endovascular options at this point?}

Some endovascular options are catheter directed thrombolysis with about
2-4mg of tPA injected into the clot, followed by balloon angioplasty
(typically an 8mm by 8cm high pressure balloon). A mechanical
thrombectomy device, such as angiojet, can also be used in combination
to thrombolysis.

Alternatively, an open thrombectomy with a thromboembolectomy balloon
and patch angioplasty of venous stenosis areas can also be used.
Moreover, a hybrid approach of open thrombectomy with percutaneous
interventions of venous stenosis areas has been described. Thrombosed
fistulas are difficult to salvage, but thrombosed AV grafts have a high
likelihood of successful recannalization and should be managed
aggressively.

Immediate postoperative thrombosis of an AV graft is likely technical -
inadequate inflow (i.e.~small brachial artery) or outflow
stenosis/occlusion. Open revision and thrombectomy is often the best
option.(Paulson, Ram, and Zibari 2002)

\textbf{What are some ways to manage failing AV access in the setting of
ipsilateral vTOS?}

Performing a first rib resection in a hemodialysis patient is high risk
and controversial. However, if there is a prominent external jugular
vein, then there are reports of external to internal jugular vein
transposition offering more in line drainage and access
salvage.(DeGiovanni, Son, and Salehi 2020)

\hypertarget{sec-steal-syndrome}{%
\subsection{Steal Syndrome}\label{sec-steal-syndrome}}

\textbf{Earlier, you mentioned steal syndrome, can you explain to us
what this is?}

Steal syndrome is also known as Access Related Hand Ischemia (ARHI). It
is an uncommon but devastating complication of access creation. All
patients with arteriovenous fistulas have some degree of physiologic
steal or reversal of flow in part of the artery distal to the fistula.
However, this is not sufficient enough to cause ischemia. Rather,
ischemia results from inadequate collateral circulation and inability of
peripheral arteries to meet the increased demand. Diseased vessels do
not dilate and stenosis of arteries leads to decreased distal perfusion
pressure. Furthermore, hypotension during dialysis further decreases
perfusion causing symptoms. Steal can be limb threatening and is graded
as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Grade 0 - asymptomatic, no flow augmentation or steal
\item
  Grade 1 - asymptomatic, mild ischemia with signs of cool extremity and
  flow augmentation with access occlusion (May be seen in over half of
  AV access patients)(Leake et al. 2015)
\item
  Grade 2 - moderate/intermittent ischemia that is experienced only
  during dialysis and patients feel effort induced ischemic pain.
\item
  Grade 3 - severe, ischemic pain at rest with tissue loss.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What are some symptoms and signs of Steal syndrome?}

Symptoms include coolness, parasthesias, rest pain, and weakness. Signs
of steal include cool to touch, pallor, cyanosis, delayed capillary
refill, absent pulses/signals, diminished sensation, weak grip, and in
severe cases ulceration or gangrene. If the patient shows improvement
with access compression, diagnosis is confirmed.

Patients with acute pain and loss of pulses immediately after AVF
creation should first have arterial injury/thrombosis ruled out, but
then after diagnosed with steal syndrome should undergo fistula
ligation.(H. Schanzer and Eisenberg 2004; Yevzlin, Chan, and Asif 2016)

\textbf{When is an intervention necessary to treat steal syndrome?}

You do not need to intervene for grade 0 and 1.(Leake et al. 2015) For
grade 3 an intervention is mandatory. The goal of treatment includes
symptom resolution and access preservation, and this is achieved by
reducing access flow and increasing distal arterial flow.

The most important finding on duplex ultrasound to evaluate for steal
syndrome is fistula flow rate. High flow rates suggest a primary problem
with the fistula, low or normal flow suggests underlying PVD and inflow
insufficiency as etiology.(Julien Al Shakarchi et al. 2016; Leake et al.
2015) Approximately 5\% of steal is secondary to inflow stenosis.

\textbf{What are your intervention options for resolving steal
syndrome?}

There are multiple ways to manage steal syndrome, detailed as
follows:(Leake et al. 2015; Gupta et al. 2011)

\begin{itemize}
\item
  AV Fistula Banding is a simple option to reduce access flow. This is
  done by suture plication, placement of single narrowing tie or wrap by
  constrictive cuff to cause a stenosis in the AV access near the
  arterial anastomosis.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    A minimally invasive approach is used by the MILLER banding which
    uses an endoluminal 4 or 5mm balloon as a sizer and a suture is
    placed around the access with the balloon inflated.
  \item
    This procedure increases arterial inflow towards the hand. One
    technique describes using intra-operative finger pressures and
    plication to result in intraoperative increase in finger pressure by
    20\% or a minimum of 90mmHg. Flow should be maintained at 600ml/min.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Revision using distal inflow (RUDI) involves ligation of the fistula
  at the arterial anastomosis and reestablishment of flow via a more
  distal artery by bypass or vein translocation. This allows for
  decreased flow through the access by reducing the fistula diameter and
  by taking inflow form a smaller vessel. However, ultimately, the
  fistula is placed at risk.
\item
  Proximalizaiton of arterial inflow (PAI) involves ligation of AV
  anastomosis, and the inflow is moved to a more proximal level with a
  prosthetic interposition. Dialysis can be continue via the vein. The
  main advantage is the native artery's continuity.(Zanow, Kruger, and
  Scholz 2006)
\item
  Distal revascularization-interval ligation (DRIL) is ultimately
  considered the best option by many vascular surgeons due to the
  excellent results shown. There is an arterial bypass created
  originating proximal to the access and ending distal to the access,
  with ligation of the artery distal to the anastomosis. This prevents
  retrograde flow from distal vessels and allows for a low resistance
  pathway for arterial supply to the hand. DRIL may be particularly
  useful in patients with distal brachial, proximal ulnar/radial
  disease, as this can bypass the underlying stenosis as well.(Leake et
  al. 2015)
\item
  Distal radial artery ligation (DRAL) can be performed for palmar arch
  steal syndrome from radio-cephalic av accesses, to prevent reversal of
  flow in the palmar arch. However, the ulnar artery patency needs to
  evaluated first.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{neuropathy-and-neuropraxia}{%
\subsection{Neuropathy and
Neuropraxia}\label{neuropathy-and-neuropraxia}}

\textbf{What complication often presents like steal syndrome, but with
easily palpable distal pulses?}

Access creation can result in neuropathy. It is important to note that
over 2/3s of the patients have preexisting peripheral neuropathy.
Neuropathy is also graded:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Grade 0 - asymptomatic
\item
  Grade 1 - mild intermittent changes (pain, paresthesia, numbness with
  sensory deficit)
\item
  Grade 2 - moderate persistent sensory changes
\item
  Grade 3 - severe sensory changes with progressive motor loss (motion,
  strength, muscle wasting).
\end{itemize}

Ischemic Monomelic Neuropathy (IMN) is rare but occurs acutely after AV
access creation. Within hours of surgery, patients develop acute pain,
weakness, or paralysis of hand and forearm muscles with prominent
sensory loss. However, the hand is warm with palpable pulse or audible
signal in distal radial and ulnar arteries. It is important to note that
pain out of proportion is what differentiates IMN from ARHI. Treatment
is access ligation or emergent augmentation of flow.

\hypertarget{perioperative-neuropraxia}{%
\subsection{Perioperative neuropraxia}\label{perioperative-neuropraxia}}

\textbf{What are some common technical complications after placement of
AV access?}

Post operative numbness of the thumb, index and middle finger and
weakness of abduction and grip strength may suggest median nerve
neuropraxia and will likely resolve. However, you need to rule out steal
syndrome.(Talebi et al. 2011; Vahdatpour et al. 2012)

Postoperative hematoma can often just be observed. However, signs of
median nerve compression mandate immediate operative brachial sheath
evacuation or the neurologic deficits may become permanent.(Padberg,
Calligaro, and Sidawy 2008)

Prosthetic grafts can results in seroma from ultrafiltration of the
graft and most resolve without intervention.

\hypertarget{bleeding-and-aneurysm}{%
\subsection{Bleeding and Aneurysm}\label{bleeding-and-aneurysm}}

\textbf{What presentations require urgent revision?}

Fistulas that present with bleeding from a visible ulcer, wet scabbing,
frank infection or acute pseudoaneurysm often require urgent open
revision. Some access may be salvaged, but in acute presentations with
significant risk of life threatening hemorrhage the safest option may be
to ligate the access and place a temporary dialysis access
line.(Galbusera, Remuzzi, and Boccardo 2009)

\textbf{Many fistulas develop aneurysms over time. When do fistula
aneurysms require revision?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Pseudoaneurysms often result from trauma due to repeated punctures or
  poor technique
\item
  True aneurysms result from long standing hemodynamically significant
  outflow stenosis.(Hossny 2014; M. S. Patel et al. 2015)
\end{itemize}

Both can lead to cannulation difficulties, increased risk of thrombosis,
pain, bleeding and cosmetic deformities. AV aneurysms should be revised
if they develop skin thinning, ulceration or bleeding. Early skin
changes can be observed. Intervention often requires revision with open
plication/excision or ligation. When isolated to a short segment,
attempts should be made to salvage the fistula.(Al-Jaishi et al. 2017;
Al-Thani et al. 2017; Pasklinsky et al. 2011)

\hypertarget{dialysis-catheters}{%
\section{Dialysis Catheters}\label{dialysis-catheters}}

\textbf{While ideally every patient would have surgically placed access,
many patients still receive dialysis through catheters. What is the
difference between an acute and chronic hemodialysis catheter?}

Chronic catheters have a subcutaneous cuff at the exit site and tunneled
to the vein. This decreases infection rates and makes them less likely
to become dislodged. Tunneled hemodialysis catheters can be used up to
12 months.

\textbf{If catheters cause so much problems such as infection and
central venous stenosis, what would be an indication for them?}

The most common indication would be for urgent hemodialysis. But other
indications include patient who are not operative candidates due to
advanced comorbidities, or patients who are unable to have an AVF or AVG
due to anatomic feasibility. Temporary dialysis access may also be
needed in patients who have just had a peritoneal dialysis catheter
placement or in chronic peritoneal dialysis catheter patients requiring
abdominal or inguinal surgery.

\textbf{Which site is the most ideal site for a hemodialysis catheter?}

The right internal jugular vein with a tip in at the cavo-atrial
junction is preferred because it has the best patency. Subclavian veins
are avoided due to high risk of stenosis and femoral veins are avoided
due to infection risk.

If all traditional access sites are inaccessible, translumbar IVC
catheters may be used as a last resort as salvage. Overall complications
are similar to other permanent dialysis access sites, however obesity is
a relative contraindication due to potential migration into the soft
tissues.

\textbf{Every procedure has potential complications. What are the
immediate complications of catheter placement?}

When placed in the internal jugular veins, there is always a chance of a
pneumothorax or hemothorax. Wire embolism can occur is control of the
wire is lost during the procedure. If the guidewire is placed too far,
then there is always a chance of arrhythmia. Thus, the best place for
the wire is through the IVC. With a left internal jugular vein approach,
there is always a risk of thoracic duct laceration. If a leak is
apparent, then the catheter needs to be removed immediately and a
pressure dressing applied.

\textbf{How do you manage infected hemodialysis lines?}

Infected hemodialysis lines should be removed. Ideally you should avoid
replacing any lines until blood cultures have been negative for 48hrs,
particularly subsequent permanent lines(V. A. 2006. W. Group 2006)

\hypertarget{peritoneal-dialysis}{%
\section{Peritoneal Dialysis}\label{peritoneal-dialysis}}

\textbf{Although not often managed by the vascular surgeon, we should
still be aware of another method of dialysis in renal failure patients.
What are the indications for peritoneal dialysis?}

Peritoneal dialysis is better tolerated and less disruptive to daily
life, so is often a better option for young, active patients with less
comorbidities. PD can be considered first-line or in patients who are
not candidates for HD, but require high patient engagement and education
and so may not be appropriate for patients with other chronic diseases
limiting independence, unstable housing, cognitive decline or poor
management other medical issues.(Ansari 2011)

From a technical standpoint, PD may be difficult in patients who have
had multiple previous open abdominal surgeries, but can be tolerated in
patients who have had minimally invasive or minor abdominal
procedures.(Sinnakirouchenan and Holley 2011) Long dwell times with
glucose solution can sometimes lead to hyperglycemia. The major reason
for conversion from PD to HD is PD catheter infection.(S. Li et al.
2017)

\hypertarget{demographics-5}{%
\section{Demographics}\label{demographics-5}}

\textbf{What is an aortic dissection?}

It's when a tear occurs in the intima that results in separation of
layers of the intima and media and allows blood to flow through the
false lumen.

\textbf{How common are they and how serious are they?}

Acute dissections occur around 3/100000 - 2-3x more common than ruptured
aortic aneurysm. For Type A dissections, early mortality 1-2\% per hour
- if untreated, 20\% die within 6 hours, 50\% within 24 hours, 70\%
first week.

Main cause of death in type A is aortic rupture into the pericardium,
acute aortic regurgitation, and coronary ostia compromise. While
patients with descending thoracic aortic dissections are more likely to
die from end organ compromise due to obstruction of visceral or
extremity vessels in the acute phase of the disease.

\textbf{The time frame is also important.}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Hyperacute \textless24 hours
\item
  Acute \textless{} 2 weeks
\item
  Subacute 2 weeks -- 3 months -\textgreater{} TEVAR
\item
  Chronic \textgreater3 months -\textgreater{} Chronic aneurysmal
  degeneration/ partial false lumen thrombosis (highest risk) =
  operative treatment
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{classification-and-terminology}{%
\subsection{Classification and
Terminology}\label{classification-and-terminology}}

\textbf{When we think about aortic dissections there are a few
classifications, how can we break it down?}

Historically, there are the Stanford and Debakey Criteria.

Anatomical Stanford

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Type A - involves the ascending aorta, 2/3 (most common)
\item
  Type B - arises from distal to L subclavian, 1/3
\end{itemize}

Debakey

\begin{itemize}
\item
  A

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    1 - ascending + descending
  \item
    2 - ascending only
  \end{itemize}
\item
  B - distal or at the LSCA.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    3a - Descending aorta above diaphragm
  \item
    3b - Descending aorta above and below diaphragm
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{How about the new system proposed by Dr Lombardi, the SVS-STS
classification system?}

The new system published in 2020 keeps A and B and adds a number system
which divides the aorta into zones from 0 proximally to 12 distally in
the mid SFA. (Lombardi, Hughes, et al. 2020)

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{images/thoracic_dissection1.png}

}

\end{figure}

Type A is now JUST the ascending aorta to the innominate, also called
Zone 0.

Type B is now an entry tear in Zone 1 or greater and distally to
whichever zone the dissection lands in.

\hypertarget{penetrating-aortic-ulcer-and-intramural-hematoma}{%
\subsubsection{Penetrating Aortic Ulcer and Intramural
Hematoma}\label{penetrating-aortic-ulcer-and-intramural-hematoma}}

\textbf{This anatomical classification is based on reading the CT angio.
What else could we see on a CT angio that we have to know about?}

So aside from the aortic dissection its self, you could see a bleb of
contrast sticking out. That could be an \textbf{penetrating aortic
ulcer}. That is an atherosclerotic plaque that penetrates the internal
elastic lamina of the aortic wall.(Ciccone et al. 2016)

Another key finding can be an \textbf{intramural hematoma} which is a
hyper-dense crescent shaped hemorrhage within the aortic wall. There is
no identifiable direct communication between the true and false lumen.
IMH are classified in the same way but with the abbreviation IMH p-d
zones.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{images/thoracic_dissection2.png}

}

\end{figure}

\textbf{Whats the significance of these two in combination?}

There is a higher chance of aortic rupture if a penetrating aortic ulcer
is seen with intramural hematoma.

\textbf{When a patient presents with an aortic dissection how can we
classify them clinically?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Uncomplicated

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Stable hemodynamics
  \item
    No evidence of malperfusion
  \item
    Pain controlled
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Complicated

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    End organ ischemia / malperfusion
  \item
    Rupture or impending rupture
  \end{itemize}
\item
  High risk for early complication or continued growth(Bogerijen et al.
  2014; Reutersberg et al. 2018)

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Uncontrollable pain / hypertension
  \item
    Bloody pleural effusion
  \item
    Aortic diameter \textgreater40mm / False lumen diameter
    \textgreater{} 22mm
  \item
    Readmission
  \item
    Radiographic only malperfusion
  \item
    Entry tear on the lesser curve
  \item
    Number vessels originating from false lumen and length of
    dissection.(Brunkwall et al. 2014; Kamman et al. 2017; Nienaber et
    al. 2009)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What is the danger of a false lumen? How does it lead to
symptoms and malperfusion? Likewise which arteries commonly branch off
the true lumen?}

The false lumen can lead to end organ ischemia as the intimal flap can
cover the ostia of branching vessels. This can be a static or a dynamic
obstruction.

Likewise it also leads to weakening in the wall of the aorta which can
become a threatened rupture or rupture if the diameter of the false
lumen is larger than 22mm.

The celiac trunk, SMA, right renal typically come of the true lumen.
Left renal comes off the false.

Also the dissection most commonly goes down into the left common iliac
rather than the right. You might be able to detect down stream effects
of this on clinical exam with reduced left sided groin pulse.

The presence of multiple false lumens is associated with increased risk
of aortic dissection related death.(Sueyoshi et al. 2013)

\textbf{What kind of patients get aortic dissections?}

Hypertension (older patients) vs cocaine or Meth (younger patients)

Marfans, Loeys-Dietz, Vascular Ehlers Danlos (Type 4), Turners,
arteritis, Bicuspid aortic valve.

We also have a traumatic cause of aortic dissections. That being called
blunt thoracic aortic injury:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Grade 1: intima tear
\item
  Grade 2: IMH
\item
  Grade 3: Pseudo aneurysm
\item
  Grade 4: Aortic rupture.
\end{itemize}

Chapter~\ref{sec-trauma-endo}

\hypertarget{presentation-5}{%
\subsection{Presentation}\label{presentation-5}}

\textbf{How do these patients present?}

Signs and symptoms -- Chest pain 90\% tearing pain radiating between the
shoulder blades.

Chest pain extending to the abdomen abdomen? Think mesenteric ischemia
or aortic tear

Type A - Stroke 5-10\%, Syncope 15\%, tamponade, carotid dissection,
paralysis.

Others: MI, Hypovolemic shock, leg ischemia

\hypertarget{evaluation-6}{%
\section{Evaluation}\label{evaluation-6}}

\textbf{What is the workup?}

Physical Exam --Asymmetric pulses / blood pressure differences /
Diastolic murmur,

Investigations - CXR, EKG, D-dimer + Troponin, CTA, ECHO for type A.

The big distinction is to find out if this is a type A or type B because
the treatment strategy is completely different.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Type A need an emergent operation
\item
  Type B starts with medical management, follow up CT angiogram +/-
  Trans esophageal echo in the OR. Reevaluate at 24 hours.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{management-11}{%
\section{Management}\label{management-11}}

\textbf{What are the details of Type A treatment?}

Operative treatment with a 30\% operative mortality. Let cardiothoracic
take the lead on this one. However vascular surgeons should be involved
in the management of type A as after the repair, a type A can become a
functional type B.

\textbf{Type B is in the realm of vascular surgery. What is the first
management step after we have diagnosed a type B dissection?}

Invasive impulse therapy aimed to reduce aortic wall stress.(G. C.
Hughes, Andersen, and McCann 2013; Nienaber and Clough 2015) That means
reducing the force of transmitted impulse down the aorta with blood
pressure goals of 100-120mmHg and Hr \textless{} 60bpm.

\textbf{How would you achieve that?}

Start with a beta-blocker (esmolol or labetalol) first then a
vasodilator (nitroprusside). This is to stop the sympathetic surge after
vasodilation that could increase pressure and thus tearing forces inside
the aorta worsening the dissection.

Initial CT, 72 hours, 3 months x 4, q6 months x2, q12 month. (Descending
thoracic aorta that dilates first.)

\textbf{Why isn't open surgery indicated for type B dissections?}

Open surgery is not recommended due to the high mortality 30\% if
\textless{} 48 hours. 18\% if \textgreater{} 49 hours.(Trimarchi et al.
2006)

In the acute setting mortality can be up to 50\% with a 20\% paraplegia
risk. Its been described as sowing tissue paper.

\textbf{What is the management plan for a complicated Type B aortic
dissection?}

Start with invasive medical management and plan for TEVAR. The goal with
TEVAR being to direct the blood flow into the true lumen and seal the
entry tear. If there was a dynamic obstruction (flap occludes branching
vessels.) Then TEVAR would reestablish the true lumen hence removing the
dynamic obstruction. Endovascular fenestration can also equalize the
pressure in the true and false lumen. (Lombardi, Gleason, et al. 2020)

For a static occlusion there could be a thrombus or stenosis in the
branched vessel so a stent might be indicated.

\textbf{What are the major risks of TEVAR in the management of Type B
aortic dissections?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Retrograde type A (reported 2\% in literature however it can be around
  20\% in some experiences). Carries a high mortality (ranging from
  7-50\%). Factors associated with retrograde dissection include:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Over-sized endograft - every 1\% over 9\% results in an increase in
    retrograde dissection of 14\%.(Canaud et al. 2014)
  \item
    Proximal landing zone more than 40mm (2\% -\textgreater{} 18\%)
  \item
    Periprocedural hypertension
  \item
    Underlying aortopathy.(Tjaden et al. 2018)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Paraplegia (reported around 5\%)
\item
  Stent induced new entry.
\end{itemize}

Arko's conversation on the BackTable podcast} to learn more about the
complications of TEVAR management in dissections.

\end{tcolorbox}

\textbf{Is there a role for TEVAR in \ul{uncomplicated} type B
dissections?}

The INSTEAD and INSTEAD XL trials looked at uncomplicated Type B
dissections. There was NO statistical difference at 2 years comparing
OMT vs TEVAR but at 5 years there was good aortic remodeling and better
long term survival in patients treated in the sub-acute stage.

Timing for TEVAR is a difficult choice. In chronic dissections the
septum thickens leading to a potentially difficult TEVAR. Anecdotally,
TEVAR is best at 2 weeks to 3 months.

It should be noted, that both the thoracic and abdominal aorta often
continue to dilate even after repair so follow up surveillance is
paramount.(Famularo, Meyermann, and Lombardi 2017)

If repair must extend into Zone 2, then pre-TEVAR carotid subclavian
bypass should seriously be considered in elective/urgent inpatient
setting to reduce the risk of periprocedural stroke (1.9\% vs
14.3\%).(Bradshaw et al. 2017; Teixeira et al. 2017) Revascularization
of the L subclavian with a L subclavian bypass is particularly important
with a LIMA CAMB or a dominant L vertebral and a transposition is not
appropriate.(M. D. Morasch 2009b; Matsumura et al. 2009)

Treatment for thoracoabdominal aneurysms has become a bit of
sub-specialization within vascular surgery, with the best outcomes
achieved at high-volume centers with close partnerships with
cardiothoracic surgery.(Cowan et al. 2003) While the majority of
vascular surgeons may not manage these patients in their day to day
practice, and many trainees have limited exposure, this topic is still
fair game for examinations and should be reviewed. However, endovascular
techniques are still evolving and practice varies widely between centers
and so covering this topic may not be particularly high yield.

This chapter was developed by surgeons in the United Kingdom, where
manufactured custom devices have broader regulatory approval and are
more widely available. The availability of these devices in the United
States is more limited and so management decisions are different
depending on what devices are available. However, the basic principles
of open management and overall clinical decision making are shared no
matter what side of the Atlantic ocean you practice.

\textbf{Can you take us through the Crawford classification to start
off?}

The Crawford classification is relatively recent (1986) and is a very
practical classification, depending on body cavity and how to get to an
aneurysm.(Crawford et al. 1986) This classification doesn't follow an
expected pattern as getting either more extensive or less extensive.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Type I} - These extend from the left subclavian down to just
  below the diaphragm, which distinguishes it from an isolated thoracic
  aneurysm, which you can get to just from the chest. Going into a
  second body cavity is a very important differentiating marker.
\item
  \textbf{Type II} - These are the biggies, they extend from the left
  subclavian all the way down to your bifurcation. So both abdominal and
  thoracic exposure, all the visceral, renal arteries and a lot of
  intercostal and lumbers--so big impact for cord supply, et cetera.
\item
  \textbf{Type III} - These extend from the mid chest down to and
  involving the viscera, renals, and bifurcation. These differentiate
  from Type 2 because you may not need to utilize full support and may
  risk a clamp and go approach.
\item
  \textbf{Type IV} - These are characterized by being accessible from
  the abdomen, in most patients, although it often does require division
  of the crus. In most patients, because there are some anatomical
  situations with body habitus, which means that going into the left
  chest is useful even for type four aneurysm.
\item
  \textbf{Type V} - This was an additional classification that was added
  by Dr.~Hazim Safi's group later, which is a bit like a type III at the
  top of the type I at the bottom effectively.(Safi and Miller 1999)
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{There appears to have been an increase in the incidence of
thoracoabdominal aneurysms. Do you think it's a true increase or does
this relate to having scans for other reasons picked up by accident and
then going on from that? What sort of many referrals do you get in a
year and what's your turn down?}

The overall incidence of infrarenal atherosclerotic abdominal aneurysms
is going down every year in the national UK vascular registry, likely
related to smoking reduction for a big group of patients. I think
thoracoabdominal aneurysms are going up partly because we are now
imaging more and more people and therefore we are imaging the chest and
seeing them.

So that's an artificial increase in incidence, but also the rate of
aortic dissection is on the rise and chronic post dissection aneurysms
are increasing. In addition, I think it's a small group, but there is
more knowledge about connective tissue disease, genetic studies and
family screening, which perhaps is also a small part of annual increase.
So over the next 10-20 years, aneurysms are not going to go away, and
there is a huge number now within the national UK screening program
under surveillance for small aneurysms.

\hypertarget{etiology-3}{%
\subsection{Etiology}\label{etiology-3}}

\textbf{Are there major differences in presentation and etiology between
thoracoabdominal aneurysms and abdominal aortic aneurysms from your
experience?}

On presentation, the majority of aneurysms are asymptomatic so they are
most often found incidentally. Rarely, they get symptomatic and can get
tender as they approach a time when the wall is going to breach
pre-rupture. I think thoracoabdominal aneurysms tend to be a bit more
symptomatic than infrarenal but may have some atypical symptomatic
presentations.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Some that extend into the arch may present with hoarseness from
  recurrent laryngeal tension or bronchial compression.
\item
  There is a group that cause dilatation of the crus. The crus of the
  diaphragm acts like an extrinsic wrap and can be extremely tight.
  These patients present with excruciating pain, radiating around their
  costal margin, which is a presentation not often thought of as a sign
  of an aneurysm.
\item
  The larger extent and more chronic aneurysms may even present with
  things like weight loss and general poor health.
\end{itemize}

The other group that is a little different than infrarenal aneurysms, is
the post dissection aneurysms. The majority of these are known and
followed closely, however there was a time when patients with a type A
dissections that extended all the way down were only followed with with
echo of the ascending and the rest was forgotten about. Many of them got
lost from cardiothoracic follow up. That group is a different group
because we already know they've got an aneurysm. So there are subtle
differences.

And then the connective tissue group, I suppose, is a bit different
because they tend to have more extensive aneurysms rather than just
confined to the infrarenal segment, which is by far and way, the most
common for abdominal aneurysms.

\textbf{Do you think patients with thoracic aneurysms as a result of
dissection or connective tissue disease have a different threshold for
intervention compared to the non-connective tissue disorder patients?}

I think we need to be aware that the connective tissue disorders we talk
about---Marfans, Loeys Dietz, vascular Ehlers Danlos---are probably the
tip of the iceberg. There are likely a number of other cases that we
don't have genetic sequencing for, but behave differently than classic
atherosclerotic aneurysms. The data from a dimension point of view is
not quite as robust as one would hope, but the threshold that most
people would agree for non connective tissue disorders would be about
six centimeters. That takes into account the increased risks of
operating both in the chest and the abdominal segment.

I think most people would agree that five centimeters is a better cutoff
for connective tissue patients. Some cardiac surgeons would repair a
young Marfan ascending aneurysm at four and a half centimeters. It does
vary a little bit geographically, a bit like the threshold for
infrarenal aneurysms, which varies between Europe, the States and the
UK. So you've got to look at the patient in front of you and make a
decision. I would certainly increase the threshold for someone who was
not so fit and perhaps lower it a bit for a younger patient.

For more about connective tissue related aortopathies, see
Chapter~\ref{sec-aortopathies}

Also, be aware if it's something odd anatomically---a saccular bulge, an
eccentric penetrating aortic ulcer (PAU), or something where you think
there could be a mycotic element---those are all very different. You
can't be reassured by a dimension in an axial plane that is safe. These
findings up the ante, in terms of whether you would repair at an earlier
threshold because they do not behave like a conventional fusiform
aneurysm.

\textbf{Can you talk us through the Ishimaru zones of the aorta?}

Ishimaru is a useful classifications. There are a lot classifications in
medicine, but it's nice to find one that's actually useful. This
classification made sure that everyone was on the same page when
reporting proximal seals zones for thoracic devices. That is important
for two reasons:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  The extent of coverage
\item
  The complications increased, the more proximally you go. The main
  complication for that is stroke.
\end{enumerate}

So historically, Ishimaru decided to classify these zones as(Ishimaru
2004):

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Zone 0}, the first most proximal zone, is the ascending aorta
  up to and including the brachiocephalic trunk
\item
  \textbf{Zone 1} is between the brachiocephalic trunk and including the
  left common carotid artery
\item
  \textbf{Zone 2} is between the left common carotid artery and
  including the left subclavian artery
\item
  \textbf{Zone 3} is the aortic segment just distal to the left
  subclavian artery.
\item
  \textbf{Zone 4}, added by some people, is distal to the T4 level,
  which is much lower down the thoracic aorta
\end{itemize}

Most thoracic stenting will go really to zone three or perhaps into zone
two. The more proximal you go, the more work needs to be done in terms
of either extra anatomical debranching or using some form of fenestrated
or branched arch device with an increase in stroke risk. What this
allowed people to do is compare different series. You're not just saying
these were a group of TEVAR patients, but you could define exactly how
proximally they go.

And the same applies for the Crawford classification. It allows
comparison within thoracoabdominal groups, and that's important with
both survival and complication rates. Because if your series is mainly
type II thoracoabdominal aneurysms, you're going to have a very
different outcomes from someone who's got mainly type IV aneurysms. Both
classifications allow you to look at and compare data between groups.

dissections, please see Chapter~\ref{sec-aortic-dissection}

\section{Management}\label{management-12}}

\hypertarget{ascending-aorta-and-arch}{%
\subsection{Ascending aorta and arch}\label{ascending-aorta-and-arch}}

\textbf{The cardiac surgeons use many different techniques for managing
an ascending aortic aneurysm or dissections, which is beyond the scope
of this review. However, in preparation for management of aneurysms or
dissections that extend beyond the arch, they often utilize an elephant
trunk down the descending aorta. Can you briefly summarize the
difference between a conventional elephant trunk and a frozen elephant
trunk, and when to use one over the other?}

This is particularly pertinent to aortic dissection. The the main
purpose of repair in Type A dissection is to protect the heart. People
die of either rupture into pericardium causing tamponade or stripping
the coronary ostia off and getting myocardial ischemia. So the priority
of repair in acute ascending aortic dissection is primarily to protect
the heart and to some extent to ensure a true lumen flow distally.
Therefore, it was very popular because it was the least invasive to do a
short interposition ascending repair, but that left problems for later.

As people became more adept with cardiac and cerebral protection, it
became more popular to do a more extensive repair in the first sitting.
This involves an arch repair and an acceptance that eventually the
descending thoracic aorta will still need to be repaired, but at a later
stage. The ascending and arch is done from a median sternotomy, and it's
really difficult to get beyond the left subclavian from that position.

So when the arch was done, the elephant trunk came from leaving an extra
piece of Dacron within the descending thoracic aorta in the true lumen
of a dissection or in the main lumen of an aneurysm by a double sewing
technique on the distal anastomosis and then inverting it down the
descending thoracic aorta. The benefit of that was when returning to
repair descending thoracic segment via left thoracotomy, you
couldquickly open the aorta and clamp that Dacron for a ready, made
proximal anastomosis. This was much easier, because it meant you didn't
have to dissect all the way up to the left subclavian with scar tissue
and a previous anastomosis.

Now, what industry realized is that they could help with this procedure
by developing a Dacron device sized to be an arch replacement which had
three or four ready-sewn 10 millimeter branches with an extra pipe for
rewarming. These branches are used as bypasses to the innominate,
carotid and subclavian and attached to that piece of Dacron was a stent
graft, which could be placed distally in lieu of what was previously a
floppy piece of Dacron.

And two manufacturers, JOTEC and Terumo Aortic, have made these devices,
which facilitate and make things much easier. Therefore, so-called FET
or frozen elephant trunk, has now become quite popular. I don't quite
know why it's called frozen, but I think it perhaps means that the
thoracic segment is stiff with a supported stent graft rather than just
a floppy Dacron segment.

\hypertarget{isolated-thoracic-aneurysms}{%
\subsection{Isolated Thoracic
Aneurysms}\label{isolated-thoracic-aneurysms}}

\textbf{For isolated thoracic aneurysm treated with TEVAR, what is the
optimal landing zone?}

So I think the isolated, thoracic aneurysm is a perfect application for
TEVAR because if you can get a good seal zone, proximally and distally,
it provides an an endoluminal approach and saves a thoracotomy, which is
a massive difference for these patients. Unfortunately I suppose those
cartoons you see on the industry advertisements are vanishingly rare,
when you've got a perfect proximal and distal landing zone and a really
straight thoracic aorta.

I think for the majority of cases, you need a 2cm seal zone proximally
and distally. However, if you have a torturous aorta, you likely need a
longer seal zone. You want to land in an area where there is a good
parallel walled walled segment. You have to be careful of so-called
``bird-beaking'' when a stiff, less conformable device lands perfectly
on the outer curve, but holds off on the inner curve. This results in a
lip, which protrudes and allows blood to get under that and cause stent
graft crushing.(Marrocco-Trischitta et al. 2019)

Modern day outcomes are very good, because I think modern devices have
become much more conformable. We've learned many lessons to avoid too
much oversizing and how to taper stent grafts when there's mismatch
between proximal and distal landing zones.

These have all significantly improved things, but there's still no
getting away from the fact that some anatomy is not well adjusted to the
currently available stent grafts. Gothic arches, torturous and large
sacks, are a problem and can allow a stent graft to move away from the
center line to the outer curve.(Iwakoshi et al. 2019) If that sac
doesn't shrink, you can imagine that draws on both the proximal and
distal seals zone, and reduces them.

I think you can sometimes get away with a shorter landing zone. If, for
example, you're doing a post traumatic aneurysm where it's only on one
segment of the outer wall where there's a problem. But for the vast
majority of true aneurysms, you need that seal zone and you do need to
oversize to achieve that.

For more on the endovascular management of traumatic aneurysms, see
Chapter~\ref{sec-trauma-endo}

\textbf{Do you utilize rapid ventricular pacing when deploying these
stents?}

I think the majority of aneurysms at the left subclavian area, you can
just drop the blood pressure to a systolic of 70 or 80
pharmacologically. Once you go more proximal to that, especially if
you've got a custom device, with a scallop or branched device where you
need an absolutely critical landing zone, you then really need to
achieve a short transient period of circulatory arrest, either with
adenosine, which is perhaps sometimes a bit unreliable, or rapid pacing.

Rapid Pacing can be difficult and does come with complications though,
such as ventricular puncture. There are some newer techniques in terms
of caval occlusion balloons, which basically stop venous blood returning
to the heart with a reduction in output. Those are gaining popularity
certainly in Germany and they can be quite effective for that. I think
having tip capture on devices and better, more accurate deployment and
better imaging does allow you to be more accurate in deployment, but
there are still problems.

These devices have been inserted to very torturous iliac systems
sometimes and they retain some energy. When you deliver them by removing
that sheath, sometimes that energy is still there and they can jump
forward as well as back. This can cause problems because you end up
covering a vessel that you didn't intend to.

\textbf{As we have described TEVAR is a great option for the majority of
isolated, thoracic aneurysms, but is there still a place for open
repair?}

I'm not so sure in isolated, thoracic aneurysms, unless for some reason
they're not suitable for TEVAR. I think if you've got problems with a
mycotic aneurysm or a fistula into the bronchus or esophagus, these are
our big problems with high mortality and your duty bound to go for open
repair.

Patients with hemoptysis and a previous aortic repair should carry a
high suspicion for an aortobronchial fistula. TEVAR is considered
preferred repair, due to high morbidity and mortality with open repair.
Bronchoscopy should be avoided due to high risk of rebleeding.(Bailey et
al. 2011; Léobon et al. 2002; Quintana et al. 2006)

Certainly with connective tissue patients, open has advantages. In some
unique situations it is possible to bridge between repairs. I think in
some of the younger connective tissue patients, they will end up having
certain segments repaired at different stages of their life. Although
it's probably now accepted that ``all endovascular'' is not a good
option for these patients, if you've got Dacron proximally and distally
already, bridging those segments with an endovascular device might work
well. Although the Dacron will slowly dilate, it won't dilate as much as
aortic tissue in these patients. So there are options, but I think in
reality, isolated, thoracic aneurysms on reasonable rare and TEVAR can
be used for the majority of them.

\hypertarget{thoracoabdominal-aneurysms}{%
\subsection{Thoracoabdominal
Aneurysms}\label{thoracoabdominal-aneurysms}}

\textbf{Moving on to thoracoabdominal aneurysms. Earlier we used the
Crawford classification to describe the anatomical extent of the
thoracoabdominal aneurysm. So let's talk firstly, about type 1, 2, 3,
and 5, which involved the thoracic of water to a greater or lesser
extent as well as the abdominal aorta. We'll come back to type IV later
on in this podcast.}

\textbf{So type II open thoracoabdominal aneurysm is arguably the most
invasive operation a patient can undergo and carries 30 day mortality in
excess of 10 to 15\%. What is the size threshold for type II that you
currently use in your practice and what is the evidence for this?}

So, as I suggested earlier, the evidence is that it's a bit historical,
and most people would actually say about six centimeters. I think that
can be brought down a little bit for connective tissue patients and can
go up a little bit for atheromatous patients. But in general, you're
talking about a younger segment of patients. This is not an operation
for people in their eighties. Outcomes stratified by age greater than 50
found a higher rate of death, paraplegia, renal failure, cardiac
complications and length of stay.(Coselli et al. 2017) These patients
need to be in very good shape because it is a big onslaught
physiologically on them. It's not just getting them off the table, it's
getting them out of intensive care and out of hospital and to recover
back to their baseline.

I think that's one of the things that can be really difficult about this
disease. You are taking patients who are effectively functioning quite
well, and they're often relatively asymptomatic and you're putting them
through a prophylactic operation to try and prevent rupture, which no
one quite knows if or when it'll happen.

\textbf{So to that end, can you talk us through the decision making
process when you're assessing a patient with a thoracoabdominal aneurysm
types 1, 2, 3, or 5?}

I think it is really dependent on anatomy, physiology, and the patient
in front of you. Unfortunately, it is a bit of a bespoke assessment for
an individual patient. So firstly, I think you have got to look at what
are the options for that patient, which goes from conservative to
endovascular, to open surgery.

The endovascular domain has changed hugely now with the increasing
availability of branched devices. When I started, there weren't custom
devices. There were some FEVAR devices just coming out, and we did use
long covered stents going through devices with TEVAR above. However,
there wasn't the option for what we've now got from an endovascular
perspective.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, arc=.35mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, bottomrule=.15mm, colback=white, titlerule=0mm, toprule=.15mm, breakable, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, left=2mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, opacityback=0, coltitle=black, toptitle=1mm, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-tip-color}{\faLightbulb}\hspace{0.5em}{Take a Listen}, rightrule=.15mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm]

The availability of fenestrated and branched devices is very different
between the United Kingdom, Europe and the United States. In the UK,
custom fenestrated and branched devices have received CE mark approval,
which is similar to FDA approval in the United States. These devices do
not have FDA approval in the United States, so access to them is far
more limited.

Check out \href{https://www.audiblebleeding.com/oderich/}{our
conversation with Dr.~Gustavo Oderich} where we discuss the advances in
endovascular techniques for branched and fenestrated devices in the
United States.

Check out \href{https://www.audiblebleeding.com/starnes/}{our
conversation with Dr.~Benjamin Starnes} where we discuss the process of
an investigation device exemption (IDE), which is how the majority of
custom devices are performed in the United States.

\end{tcolorbox}

So I think you've got to choose the patients that are either unsuitable
for endovascular, or are we really going to benefit from a durability of
an open approach. Those are the two big differences, and they are
differences. One, you're going for gold standard approach because you
think they're life expectancy warrants that. The other one is much
higher risk, because they haven't got another endovascular option. These
range from people with very tortuous anatomy, to difficult renal
arteries, such as early divisions, that make them unsuitable as target
vessels. Another reason is complex dissections, which are not suitable
for an endovascular approach. Therefore, it is quite variable, but the
first thing you must consider is whether this patient is going to get
through this and get out of hospital. And that really is looking at them
in the eye and considering what's their quality of life or what's their
family support, and are they up for this?

The second one then is anatomical difficulties--- Is there a shaggy
aorta, atheromatous disease, or calcification of a target vessel, etc.
Severe aortic wall thrombus is associated with solid organ infarction
(24\%), acute kidney injury, without dialysis (21\%) and delayed oral
intake by 3.4d, however rarely resulted in mortality (0.5\%).(Ribeiro et
al. 2017) Rarely is this a hundred percent or 0\% decision, but it's
about building up relative contraindications. Some of them are pretty
simple, like access problems for endovascular, and it's a combination of
those which then will sway you in one way or the other. And if anything,
that decision-making is probably more pertinent for type III and type
IV, where there really is a different option and these patients are n
their sixties and seventies with classic atheromatous disease. The
really, young fit non-connective tissue patient with a type II TAAA is a
rare beast.

\textbf{For connective tissue disease, many textbooks prefer an open
approach over an endovascular approach do you still agree with this?}

Yes, I do. I think certainly, what were you know about patients who've
had total endovascular approaches for connective tissue diseases is that
they don't last. They may last five years or so and then you get
progressive aortic dilatation and loss of those of seal zones. Whether
that is the natural history of the native disease or whether it is
regional force hooks, barbs or whatever is related to the device is
unclear.

But when you sew these pensions and just touching the back end of a
needle on the anterior wall can create a massive problem or just being a
little bit clumsy and you get a radial tear. It's very clear that a
stiff device sitting in those aortas for many years with 60-70 beats per
minute going through it and often hypertension, isn't going last.

However there are some caveats, as I mentioned earlier, bridging between
previous prosthetic open repairs is a possibility. And sometimes in a
lifesaving situation, such as when someone has presented with a rupture,
you may have to use an endovascular approach. However, be prepared then
to treat that as a bridge and go back to do a definitive repair when
things have calmed down and in the cold light of day.

\textbf{So we don't really have the scope to dive into complex
endovascular repair in this episode, but can you describe the broad
principles of your operative approach to open thoracoabdominal aneurysm
repair?}

In terms of the patient, for anything juxtarenal or type IV, I tend to
have a patient supine on their back, but with a break in the table at
the level between the costal margin and the anterior superior iliac
spine. By breaking the table at that level, you can increase the
exposure to that segment of the aorta.

However, there are some patients even with a type IV repair that demand
a left thoracoabdominal incision. For a type four, if you're doing a
left thoracoabdominal approach, it's usually for someone with a very
narrow acute angle of the costal margin, such as a more petite frame
female patient or a crus that is very high on the aorta. And if you look
at CT scans, which is something I've realized over many years, that not
everyone is the same. So where the celiac and SMA are can be in a
different proportion, depending on where the costal margin and and
skeleton is, which can make them easier or harder to get to. And
certainly in a situation, if there is a rupture within the left side of
the abdomen, you wouldn't really want to go into that without getting
proximal control. Because as you do the visceral rotation, you could
have catastrophic bleeding.

So under those circumstances, I'd also go into the left chest with a
reasonably low segment so that you can place a clamp ready before doing
the visceral rotation. So for type IV the one above then, the higher you
go, the higher your thoracotomy and the more tipped over you need the
patient. So for a type II, you're going probably fifth intercostal space
and the shoulders are at 90 degrees and the pelvis is 60 degrees. For
type three, you're slightly further over, so you're down to about 60
degrees and you're perhaps in the seventh intercostal space. So the
lower you go, then right up to being pretty much supine.

The left arm is put over top. You mark the scapular and you go into the
chest and abdomen. I tend to go intraperitonealy into the abdomen, so I
can see the bowel, although there are people who do a retroperitoneal
approach. I tend to divide the diaphragm down to the central ligament
and mark that. Then effectively you are looking at your clamp zone. You
dissect around your clamp zone, both proximally and distally. We don't
tend to expose the celiac and SMA in particular, or the right renal.
It's important to find the left renal artery. For the visceral rotation,
you effectively extend the left colon up, find the white line and get
under that and get right onto psoas. The key is to get right down on the
psoas early on, and then it is a relatively bloodless field. Everything
has taken medially to leave the ureters out of the way. I always take
for left kidney up. You will see in the textbooks and some advocate to
keep the left kidney down. I that's utter madness to be honest and I
can't see any point in it.

So for me, everything rotates up then out of the way. And it it looks a
bit strange, like a postmortem. It looks very odd to see the whole left
side abdominal cavity when all you've got is diaphragm muscle, psoas
muscle and nothing else left. It does give you a very safe exposure then
to the aorta. I don't tend to go round the aorta with slings, I think
that can cause problems. I go around with my fingers and be very aware
of the right sided lumbers or intercostals because you really don't want
to cause a problem there because you can't easily get into the right
chest from that exposure. So you have to be a bit careful so you can see
exactly where you're getting round.

\textbf{So in specifically with a type II TAAA, many people establish a
left heart bypass. Do you always operate in that way and do you use a
cardiac surgeon and the setting?}

I think type II you are mandated to have some sort of adjunct to keep
the rest of the body perfused while you're doing the proximal
anastomosis. I think in an elective setting left heart bypass is the
right way forward, because it does give you more flexibility and it
allows you then to sequentially clamp and keep the legs, the viscera or
the kidneys perfused. There are some negative aspects to left heart
bypass, though, in terms of needing a much higher ACT and bleeding is
the enemy here. The more you anti-coagulate, the more problems you've
got. It's also not pulsatile flow and you're putting all your cells
through a pump and you've got to be aware of increased problems around
stroke and everything else that goes with that. I think it is very
convenient for that set up, because you can get to the inferior
pulmonary vein quite easily and femoral cannulation is quite easy for
you to return and then you've got the option then of individually
cannulating celiac and SMA for perfusion, whereas usually renals are
cooled down.

If you've got a perfusionist there as well, you can get cold perfusate
for the renal arteries. So it gives you more flexibility, and if things
go wrong, you've then got an option to switch to conventional bypass if
needed or even drain out and go to circulatory arrest and cool-down.

However, in a more emergency setting, an approach that tends to work
quite well for us is to do an ax-fem approach. You use an ax-fem graft
onto the right subclavian artery, not tunneled but on the outside of a
body onto the right femoral and use the other limb as a single cannula,
usually for the SMA, because the SMA is the king vessel with all of
this. Most of the other things can go, but if you lose the SMA, you've
got a dead patient. And that allows you to do an emergency procedure, a
mid type III approach, without some of the problems associated with left
heart bypass. It allows you to have a lower ACT; it gives you pulsatile
flow; you're not smashing your cells up all the time; and it's
relatively quick and straightforward to do. You don't have to mobilize a
perfusionist and everything else that goes with that. It's worked well
for us in emergency settings. It's better than a clamp and go approach
because with a clamp and go approach, for the type III repair, you need
to complete in 15 minutes, your inlay anastomosis at the top, the clock
is already on. If you get down to the visceral segment and you've got to
do some removal of thrombus to get your Carrel patch on or you've got to
reimplant the left kidney separately, it's a lot of time pressure and
there's no opportunity for something to go wrong there. That's where
this gives you a bit more breathing space that you've got the lower body
perfused while you're doing your proximal anastomosis.

\hypertarget{complications-2}{%
\subsubsection{Complications}\label{complications-2}}

\textbf{As you've mentioned, open repair is a high tariff, high risk
operation, but apart from death, what are the specific complications to
the open approach?}

The big problems are bleeding and clamp times. Those are the things that
cause problems for those patients who survive. So problems with large
transfusion which cause problems with ventilation afterwards. The most
common complications after a TAAA are pulmonary with 8.5\% of one cohort
requiring a tracheostomy.(Coselli et al. 2016) Renal ischemia is an
issue of people will quote a 40 to 50 minute renal warm ischemic time,
you increase your risk of renal failure. They may need to go on the
hemofilter for temporary support, but these patients have already lost a
lot of nephrons, so they haven't got a huge amount of capacity to lose
more. That's why eGFR or high creatinine is a really important
prognostic marker of outcome in this patients. I think it's like a
barometer on their micro-circulation.

The big one and the Achilles heel of these approaches, whether it's
endovascular or open is spinal cord ischemia and that is because of the
segmental of blood supply to the cord comes from all the intercostals
and lumbers. If you've got that aneurysm extending both proximally and
distally involving the internal iliacs the left subclavian, then you're
taking out your crucial collateral supply. Important aspects to reduce
ischemia include:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Getting the legs back in circuit early, whether that's removing the
  large sheaths, during a endovascular repair or getting the leg supply
  earlier in an open approach.
\item
  Keeping the left subclavian in circuit.
\item
  Maintain the mean arterial pressure in theater
\item
  Place a spinal drain and ensure it is working.
\end{itemize}

Post TEVAR leg weakness needs to undergo urgent evaluation. Differential
diagnosis includes spinal ischemia due to subclavian or intercostal
artery coverage, distal embolization or stenosis of the TEVAR graft.
Stenosis should be treated with angioplasty and extension.(Buth et al.
2007)

\textbf{So the major issue is the spinal cord ischemia, can you explain
in more detail the blood supply for the spinal cord and how this plays
into the occurrence of spinal cord ischemia?}

So it's complicated actually. There are anterior and posterior spinal
arteries, but I think depending on what level you are in the cord, they
get a blood supply from a more dominant approach. So higher up in the
cord---cervical and higher thoracic---vertebral arteries are important,
so hence the importance of a left subclavian bypass.

The lower you go, then they become a bit less important and the actual
segmental arteries, intercostals, become dominant. Much is talked about
the artery of Adamkiewicz. I think, yes, there may be a dominant vessel
at about the level of the 9th-12th intercostal, but it's rarely one,
absolutely single one that if you preserve that one, then the rest don't
matter. I think they all matter.

And then the more distally you go, collateral supply from internal
iliacs, median sacral, all those contribute to a collateral circulation
that should be seen in some ways all connected. And that is why, more
recently in endovascular approaches, staging repair is really useful
because you can allow the surviving arteries then to remodel and
increase flow. It's why, during a type II repair, when you get the whole
aorta open, it's very important to block the intercostals early---either
by sewing them off or putting a little Pruitt balloon in and to stop
losing blood from that collateral supply. It keeps the pressure in the
spinal cord. Also the differential position of that blood supply is why
patients then get a particularly prominant motor problems and sometimes
preservation of sensation.

\textbf{So purely for exam purposes and a bit of physiology. Can you
remind us how to calculate the spinal cord perfusion?}

All that is really is MAP minus the CSF pressure. So it's your mean
arterial pressure, take out the CSF pressure and that's what you've got
perfusing the spinal cord. It is a useful equation to remember because
it allows you to decide what's the way to enhance spinal perfusion as
much as possible, which is to increase MAP and decrease your CSF
pressure. We do that by enhancing the mean arterial pressure as much as
possible, and draining off CSF with a spinal drain to reduce your CSF
pressure and allow more blood into the cord.

I think people perhaps get a bit hung up on spinal drainage and it's
importance. It is just as important to maintain oxygenation and
hemoglobin over 100 (which is equal to 10 g/dL in the USA), reduce blood
loss and all those other things are as crucial. Spinal drainage is an
adjunct, but it shouldn't be seen in isolation. It's one of many
adjuncts to try and help prevent spinal ischemia.

\textbf{So in regards to the mechanism for spinal cord ischemia during
open thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair, do you think it's related the
blood loss, clamp time or or implantation of the intercostals?}

I think it's multifactorial. So I think the majority is due to ischemia
scheme in terms of a watershed situation. Segments of a cord just not
getting enough blood. And the very reason the more typical area around
T7, 8, 9, to 10, is because it is in the middle between the vertebral
artery and internal iliac artery supply. This is probably a kin to a
splenic flexure of the colon, it's between two territories.

However, there is also potentially problems with microemboli or trashing
of a spinal arteries, which can occur in some patients. It's a slightly
confusing situation, but I think in terms of intraoperatively---blood
loss, dumps in blood pressure, with hypotensive episodes really don't
help.

\textbf{When do you remiplant intercostal arteries?}

Again, that is a bit confusing. Some people would argue if there's
massive back bleeding, you don't need to be reimplant because they're
getting collateral supply from somewhere.

I think it will depend on how the case is going. We do use motor evoked
potentials (MEPs) but that's quite a specialist situation and you're
very reliant on the readings you get. They can be confused by leg
ischemia, cooling down or edema. But if you have already got the legs
back in circuits and got the MAP up and things weren't improving and
there was a sizable intercostals that could be reimplanted, well, then
that's worth doing. And that's why the technique of using Pruitt balloon
occlusion methods in pairs rather than ligating is good because you can
then just reimplant those. If you don't need to implant them, you can
just ligate and remove them. Whereas if you've already ligated them,
you've got a problem because you've already destroyed the ostia.

We tend to leave a branch already attached in the mid thoracic aorta to
save an anastomosis. You can, if you've got really good intercostals,
fillet the branch to open it up and sew it on like a long patch
longitudinally along the paired intercostals and then plumb it back on
the other end so it's a circuit in series with your main aortic graft.
That probably decreases the resistance to flow and that might remain
patent for a bit longer, rather than having a big 10mm graft going into
a single pair of intercostals with what are likely to have quite a high
resistance, and they probably don't last as long.

Several spinal protection protocols have been described to reduce risk
of spinal ischemia or mitigate the impact of spinal ischemia in patients
who develop weakness.(Estrera et al. 2009; Yanase et al. 2012) An easy
way to remember the important components are COPS:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  C - Cerebral spine drain status - keep for 7 days, pressure less than
  5
\item
  O - Oxygen delivery - supplemental oxygen, increase hgb, increase
  cardiac index
\item
  PS - Patient Status - Keep BP greater than a MAP of 90mmHg
\end{itemize}

\textbf{So do you think we're good at predicting preoperatively who may
get spinal cord ischemia? You mentioned a few risk factors already that
can predict who will or won't post-operatively.}

I think we're utterly hopeless at it actually. I really don't think that
there's a good method. You can see people having an infrarenal repair
getting paralysis and you can completely replace the whole aorta from
the arch down to the iliacs with prosthetic and have people walking
around without a problem at all. So I don't really understand it and I
think that comes into the business about whether it is about emboli,
flow, or collaterals. I think it's a combination of things. When people
started embolizing intercostals preoperatively prior to endo repairs,
people thought this is a mad thing---you want to keep them perfused
surely. But I think it does show the importance of maximizing the
collateral supply, and I think some people have a better collateral
supply than others. And of course, what we don't know is when you get
down to the more microscopic level of actual arterial supply at cord
level, what that is like in an individual patient that you can't see on
imaging. If that is already compromised, I suspect those patients are
more at risk than whether they have a macro vascular problem when things
go wrong terms of hypotension or blood loss.

Many reports state that the highest risk factor for spinal cord ischemia
includes length of aortic coverage or repair, followed by whether they
have had a prior repair, preop hemoglobin, and intraoperative
hypotension.(Bisdas et al. 2015)

\textbf{We haven't really touched on complex endovascular repairs yet,
but can you explain when you might choose a hybrid approach to this
thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair?}

So visceral hybrid operation came in really as a bridge between open
surgery and endovascular. This is a bit dated now, because it is before
custom devices and we only had thoracic stents at this time, the era of
the Talent stent, which was a very early thoracic device made by
Medtronic. Perhaps not the perfect name because it wasn't a particularly
talented, it was a difficult thing to deploy, but it actually got us
into the thoracic aorta. What we realized was that if you could operate
in one cavity, such as the abdomen, but still excluding any aneurysm in
the chest without cross camping and without rendering that patient
ischemic over a large part of their body---they could withstand that hit
much better than open cavity surgery with cross clamp and massive
reperfusion.

So the concept of a visceral hybrid was to do an extra-anatomical bypass
of the celiac, SMA and both renals from either the distal aorta or the
iliac vessels. So patients would only get sequential ischemia of one
organ at a time, say the right kidney or the celiac territory, and
during that 10 minute anastomosis, the remainder of the body and organs
were refused. And finally, at the end that, you could then put in a
thoracic device as a freebie, because you'd already perfused the organs
from distally. You'd ligated those target vessels and then you would
just excluding the aneurysm so that you were transferring blood from
above the repair to below the repair and perfusing the vital organs
retrograde.

So it was very attractive and we started doing it quite early at
St.~Mary's and initially we had some very good results in the first 30
or so patients.(M. P. Jenkins et al. 2011) And as always, then it
allowed you to consider older, sicker patients but it wasn't easy
surgery. And actually I think because it was doable in terms of just an
abdominal approach and relatively familiar territory for anyone who's
done occlusive disease for the viscerals or renals, I think a number of
centers started doing small numbers and not getting so good results. And
then when better, custom made devices came in, I think it's purpose
became less and less because why would you do that if you had an
opportunity to do something which was even less invasive.

So what we've been left with now to consider a hybrid type approach
effectively are those patients who are physiologically not fit enough
for an open approach and those patients who are anatomically not
suitable for a total endovascular approach. In some ways, they are the
worst of both worlds in that outcome group. And so I don't think you'll
ever be able to compare outcomes legitimately with the fitter group
having a fully open approach and the anatomically suitable patients
having a total endovascular.

But I must say we still see quite a lot in our multidisciplinary reviews
coming back. What surprises me is the durability of those grafts. The
visceral grafts remain patent for many years, some of them are 15 years
now. Occasionally there will be an accessory or small diseased renal
artery, and the renal graft will go down, but the others have been
extremely durable. And even though we've had to re-line the stenting
portion or extend it, the grafts have maintained really well.

A unique situation that uses a similar technique is with mycotic
aneurysms of the visceral segment of the aorta. The mainstay of
treatment is a debranching of the aorta and debridement of the infected
aorta with in situ revascularization or ax fem-fem bypass. There is an
evolving role for FEVAR, such as with most aneurysmal disease.(Sörelius
et al. 2016; Sule and Dharmaraj 2016)

S\textbf{o moving on to Type IV thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair. These
can be repaired using endovascular or open techniques. Can you talk us
through your approach to open Type IV repair in terms of exposure and
any tips such as how to minimize the visceral ischemia?}

So I think an open Type IV from a subcostal approach is a doable and
durable procedure. And what I mean by that is that the hit to the
patient is not enormous, and a reasonably fit patient can get through
that reasonably well. You have to be a little bit selective, but not
super selective. For example, in my first hundred, I had one 30 day
death and one in hospital death, which was someone at about three months
who just didn't get better, so that puts it into perspective that
actually it's an operation with a very good outcome, if you get it right
at the beginning.

The approach I mentioned earlier, nothing too special. This is a supine
patient. Getting the break on the table in the right position to allow
you to extend the abdomen. You lower both ends of a table to open up
that segment of the abdomen and get better exposure. I tend to do the
vast majority via a subcostal approach, some people would call it
rooftop, then extending on the left side down below the costal margin a
bit. And it gives you really good exposure even if you have to go down
to the iliacs. It does cause a bit more of a problem getting to the
right iliac bifurcation. The left is easy, because it's right there next
to you. So that's an added complication.

The visceral rotation needs to be done carefully because what you do not
want is to create blood loss right at beginning. And as I mentioned
earlier, it's getting under the left colon along the white line onto
psoas and then getting up under psoas and I always tell the registrars
when they're doing it, you've got to go as far as possible on psoas from
below. And when you think you've gone as far as possible, you've got to
go another five centimeters. So you get right up to the diaphragm from
below. And then you can get into the supra-colic compartment around the
splenic flexure and get your fingers either side of the lienorenal
ligament and take that off the lateral and the posterior abdominal wall.
The more and more you do, the more you are freeing and the whole of the
viscera comes up towards the right side of a patient and eventually they
will rotate up and you've exposed the whole left wall of the aorta.

The first thing I then do is ensure that I've got a clamp zone, and I do
that by dividing the crus which sometimes can be really tense at that
level. The crus can act as an extrinsic wrap around the dilated aorta,
to an extent that the distal end of the crus is almost ligamentous,
causing a tight band on the aorta. I tend to get my finger underneath
that before it with a diathermy and opening it, and then very carefully
choosing the clamp zone and getting my fingers right round that area, so
I know I've got a healthy clamp zone.

The next thing I then do is look for the left renal artery. I've already
tended to make a decision about what I'm going to do with the left renal
artery, which depends on the number of things. So it depends on, to some
extent, the age of a patient, where the left renal is in terms of a
clock face. So if you're looking at an axial cut to the CT, the more the
left renal is around before three o'clock, up to two o'clock, the easier
it is to incorporate because you've got less aortic tissue there. If the
left renal is beyond 3:30 and posterior on the sidewall of the aorta or
if the left renal is more distal compared to the right renal, then it's
a long way away from the right renal artery and you're going be leaving
a larger patch of aorta. This is usually bad news, unless you have a
more elderly patient.

You're making this decision about whether you're going to try and
incorporate the left renal artery into a big patch or whether you're
going to reimplant it separately or perform a jump graft. So you've
already thought about that, but it's crucial to find the left renal
because when you've clamped and you've done your left aortotomy, you've
got to get that aortotomy underneath and posterior to the left renal
artery so that the orifice goes up with that segment of the aorta.

Then I tend to get the iliacs out. The left is easy, it's there. I have
no qualms on the right by going back over through the peritoneum to find
the right iliac artery to expose that. I don't go around any of them. I
just find a very discrete camp zone. You don't need much, just enough to
put a clamp on.

And then I tend to take the fat and lymphatic tissue off the left side
of aorta. So when you open the aorta, you've not got a lot of immediate
bleeding. If you've got a retro-aortic left renal vein, you've got a
line gate that cause otherwise you'd be going through it. And
surprisingly, on CT, the main left renal vein is anterior, but there is
often a vein there which has stretched across, either a lumbar or
phrenic vein, which you should deal with prior to your aortotomy.

It's about getting everything set up before you cross clamp, because
once you cross clamp, the clock is on. So it's getting the whole team
ready for that moment and making your anatomy as perfect as possible
before you do that. Obviously it goes without saying that you have cell
salvage and we use a Belmont with the big bucket on the top of it, so
that you can rapidly give blood back when you need it.

\textbf{Can you talk a little bit more about a Carrel patch and when
would you choose to do a jump graft to the left renal rather than
encompass all the vessel vessels onto that patch?}

I tend to think of a Carrel patch more in a way with a type III repair,
because with a type III repair, you've done your proximal anastomosis
and then what you're doing is you're putting on a patch of aorta to
include the celiac, SMA, and right renal, which tend to be together,
whereas sometimes the left renal is a bit away. The more tissue you
leave there, the more chance that aortic tissue will dilate to over
time, hence the patch aneurysm. If your patient has got some form of
connective tissue disease, we reimplant directly.(De Rango et al. 2011;
Afifi et al. 2017) There is a very nice graft available with four side
bunches already put on and you can go straight onto the ostia. So you're
basically leaving no aortic tissue at all.

For type IV, you are doing an oblique anastomosis and you have to be
aware that the right side of the aorta is really left there. It's a
compromise, these patients with atherosclerotic type IV aneurysms, they
may be in their sixties, seventies or even into their eighties. Even the
good candidates, they're not going to live 25-30 years, and therefore
over time that segment may begin to dilate a bit. I think that is
acceptable. Half of that segment is Dacron and the other bit may dilate.

I think if you've got a Carrel patch, which really balloons out, that's
something which is different. We don't have good data as to when those
will give away and rupture. I think what is clear is that if you've got
dehiscence between your suture line and your graft, that is a dangerous
situation, akin to a false aneurysm. And although it may look similar on
CT, that's a different beast and they're at risk at any stage. True
aneurysmal dilation of a segment that is left behind is a bit different
and I think that's a bit safer. In essence, what you're trying to do is
a compromise between leaving as little aortic tissue as possible, but
also getting the patient alive through their first repair safely.

If I know I'm not going to incorporate a left renal, then I will sew on
a six or eight millimeter side branch onto the tube golf before I cross
clamp, because that saves you one anastomosis. And then now my favorite
technique is just to amputate the left renal artery and sew that
directly onto your branch and leave that in a bit of a lazy C
configuration in the paracolic gutter, so as the rotation comes back,
it's not under tension. The other technique is to have very short graft,
right from your aortic prosthetic, but you've got to really judge how
that will sit when the kidney is back in its anatomic position. So it
can't come off the anterior aspect of the tube graft. It needs to be
further down and that's awkward to judge and I think we're probably not
good at that so the lazy C is a better approach.

I much prefer that to trying to either reimplant the native artery
directly onto the Dacron, as they tend to restenose or try to bring the
aortic sidewall down on to the Dacron. I think that's fraught with
difficulty. You've often got calcification at the ostium, and it's also
very difficult because you've got the rest of your anastomosis really
close and sometimes not enough room to bring your clamp down, which is
exactly what you want to do. The left kidney will take a bit of an extra
ischemic hit, but you want to be perfuse the right renal and viscera.
You've got to have to bring your camp down below your proximal
anastomosis.

When it comes to late complications from TAAA repair, 8\% are from
progression of aortic disease and 3\% are related to the graft repair.
Risk factors associated with late events include female sex, partial
aneurysm resection, expansion of remaining native aorta or initial
aneurysm rupture.(Clouse et al. 2003)

\textbf{Have you ever had to treat the Carrel patch aneurysm in your
career?}

We have a number from previous Type III repairs and I think these are
very suitable for fenestrated or branched devices. You've got a
beautiful lending zone, proximally and distally. Why not? These tend to
be well-suited to that and it's a much easier approach mixing endo and
open, changing from one to the other, I think that's fine. It's just at
a different stage of a patient's life and repair

\textbf{Any final summary or closing words about aortic surgery?}

We have a bit of a tipping point with open aortic surgery at the moment,
certainly in the UK. Looking at registry data, many are tipping back to
open now. Whether that was as a result of NICE guidelines, I suspect
not, perhaps that just put it more into focus. I think many people are
seeing more problems with patients surviving after what was very good
endovascular surgery at the time, but they've outlived the repair. Now
we've got problems with patients where you got to wonder whether that
wasn't perfect anatomy and should they have had open surgery?

Now the difficulty we've got at the moment is the patients that perhaps
weren't that suited for endovascular repair, did well initially from it
and they are paying the price later on. But those very patients are the
ones that are also more difficult from an open approach. They are
patients with shorter, more tortuous necks or more calcification. There
is a concern that there is an era of surgeons now that haven't done as
much open aortic surgery, who may not be as confident with adverse
anatomy.

That lack of confidence influences your decision-making, so patients
don't get a full appraisal of what options are available. The default
then may be to go with a less than perfect endovascular option. I agree,
this may be less easy to kill a patient upfront with an endo option but
you perhaps pay for that later on. This is a very difficult thing to get
around and we've got to get to a compromise of finding the patients with
the likely better life expectancy and sending them to groups with a
larger open practice and get them through a big operation safely and
capitalize on those benefits.

The really lucky ones are the ones that are anatomically really suited
for endovascular repair and their sack really shrinks and their seal
zones remain good. They are the best of both worlds as they tend to also
be fitter with less extensive disease and get the benefits from a less
invasive approach. Not all patients are the same and we've got to now
accept that we've gone down the line of working with industry, which
they didn't necessarily focus on durability. What they wanted to do is
to extend the applicability, to treat more patients and get better,
lower profile devices to go for these percutaneous cardiology market in
the United States. And we're now paying the price of some of those
decisions, so we've got to reboot and take a stance on which patients
are going to actually benefit from which approach and have a better
evaluation of that going forward.

\section{General Considerations}\label{general-considerations}}

\textbf{What are the common genetic aortopathies?}

There are several well-known genetic disorders which account for genetic
aortopathies. The most well-known are Marfan syndrome, Loeys-Dietz
Syndrome, and Vascular Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome.

There are less commonly known ones such as Familial Thoracic Aortic
Aneurysms and Dissections due to pathogenic variants smooth muscle cells
genes such as \emph{ACTA2}. There are others in which the causative gene
is not known.(Black 2019)

\textbf{Why are they such a big deal?}

These are cases in which the building blocks of the aortic wall are
defective. What I mean by this, is that these patients have pathogenic
variants in the genes that affect cell signaling or smooth muscle cell
structure that lead to suboptimal composition of the aortic wall. These
alterations ultimately lead to cystic medial necrosis in the aortic
wall.

As such they are at more risk for aortic aneurysms and dissections that
can lead to the premature death of the patient.

To put the frequency in perspective, Marfan syndrome occurs in 1:5000 of
the population while Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (also known as
VEDS) occur in 1:50000 of the population.

\textbf{Let's dive into them then -- what are the defining features of
each and the high yield information?}

The high yield information is being able to pair the genetic syndrome
and phenotype with its associated genetic mutation. A useful exercise
following this broadcast is to list the disorders in a table and write
out their associated gene mutation, what protein defect or deficit
occurs, the typical phenotype, and the common vascular pathology
associated.

But before we dive in, I want you to keep in mind some of shared
features. One is that the associated aneurysms and dissections tend to
occur at younger ages and dissect at lower blood pressures than what we
see with sporadic dissections (these are the dissections that are not
familial or associated with a syndrome)

One is that these are inherited in an autosomal dominant matter but
there can be variation in how the pathogenic variants are expressed
among affected people and even within families. The other thing to
remember, is that in roughly half of these cases, the affected patient
is the first in their family to have a given pathogenic mutation. The
flip side of this, is in half the cases, there is a family history of
aortic aneurysms, dissections, and sudden death.

\hypertarget{demographics-7}{%
\section{Demographics}\label{demographics-7}}

\textbf{We will start with Marfan syndrome.}

\ul{Marfan syndrome} is caused by pathogenic variants in the \emph{FBN1}
gene (also known as fibrillin-1 gene). These variants lead to improper
formation of the microfibrils that maintain elastin, a key component of
the arterial wall.

These patients are prone to aneurysmal degeneration and dissections of
the aortic root but can also dissect the descending thoracic aorta. They
commonly have lens dislocations (ectopia lentis). They have common
skeletal features such as being tall, thin, with long arms and legs,
scoliosis, pectus deformities (carnitatum or excavatum), and club feet.
They can also have a history of spontaneous pneumothorax and mitral
valve prolapse.

\textbf{How is Marfan syndrome similar or different from the other
genetically triggered aortopathies that you mentioned?}

\ul{Loeys Dietz Syndrome} is similar to Marfan syndrome in all the
features including the aortic root aneurysms. They don't seem to have
lens dislocation and they have other unique features such as bifid uvula
or cleft palate, and hypertelorism (which is an abnormally increased
distance between the eyes). What is different about Loeys Dietz Syndrome
from Marfan syndrome is that they can have arterial aneurysms of other
arteries instead of the aorta, such as the SMA, axillary, or other
peripheral arteries.

\ul{Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome} has some shared features to Marfan
Syndrome with both such as spontaneous pneumothorax, but these patients
tend to be short and can have easy bruising. They also have similar
features to Loeys Dietz syndrome in terms of arterial aneurysms. Common
features of VEDS would be thin translucent skin where you can easily see
their veins, thin lips, thin bridge of the nose, large eyes, easy
bruising, acrogeria -- or an aged appearance of the hands

However, unlike Marfan and Loeys-Dietz, the majority of VEDS patients
tend to not have aortic root aneurysms. One thing to remember about VEDS
is that it is a \emph{subtype} of Ehlers Danlos syndromes. It's very
important to distinguish it from the other subtypes because most of the
other 12 Ehlers-Danlos syndromes are not associated with arterial
pathology. So people with vascular EDS are prone to arterial, uterine,
and intestinal rupture and their average lifespan is 48 due to these
highly morbid pathologies. 25\% of patients with vEDS will have
experienced some clinical manifestation by age 20, and that number is
close to 90\% by age 40.

\textbf{I remember learning about classic Ehlers-Danlos presenting with
hypermobile skin and joints. Is this something you see with Vascular EDS
as well?}

Patient's with vEDS don't have the same hypermobile skin or joint laxity
as we classically think of with classic Ehlers-Danlos. In fact, some
vEDS patients report losing confidence in their physicians who ask them
about joint and skin hypermobility because it suggests to them that
their doctor doesn't know about their disease process. These patients
often know more than most of the doctors they meet about their
condition, and it's a source of constant frustration for them. It can
also be a problem if the severity of the disease is underestimated, as
we discussed they can present much younger than most patients with
highly morbid issues -- like arterial rupture.

\textbf{You mentioned arterial pathology in Loeys-Dietz and vEDS. Can
you tell me more about that?}

In both types you can see subclavian, carotid, SMA, and iliac artery
aneurysms and dissections, as well as less frequently vertebral, SFA,
and popliteal aneurysms and dissections.

\hypertarget{evaluation-7}{%
\section{Evaluation}\label{evaluation-7}}

\textbf{How do you diagnose these genetically triggered aortopathies?}

There are clinical diagnostic criteria for each, but ultimately genetic
and laboratory testing is very important for the final diagnosis.

Ghent criteria is used to clinically diagnose \ul{Marfan syndrome}. The
big ones are aortic root dilation, known family history of Marfan's or
not, the diagnosis of ectopia lentis which clinically is manifested as
iridodonesis (lens shimmering). Additionally, genetic testing for
pathogenic FBN1 variants is also diagnostic.

To date, there are 5 types of \ul{Loeys-Dietz} as of last check. These
are due to pathogenic variants in the TGF-B signaling pathway, such as
TGF-beta receptors and SMAD3 genes.

\ul{Vascular EDS} is caused by a mutation in the COL3A1 gene which
encodes a defective type of III procollagen. The defect in the
procollagen makes it unable to properly fold into a triple helix that
forms the normal collagen structure. This causes the defective
procollagen to be degraded intracellularly and as a result there is an
overall deficit in type III collagen which is an important component of
arterial walls and other structures. The confirmatory test for VEDS is
collagen testing which can confirm the collagen III defect.

\hypertarget{management-13}{%
\section{Management}\label{management-13}}

\hypertarget{medical-management-1}{%
\subsection{Medical Management}\label{medical-management-1}}

\textbf{How would you manage these patients?}

Medical optimization and surveillance is key to try to extend the time
as much as possible before they get a dissection and avoid it if at all
possible.

We start with lifestyle modification. Avoid ``burst'' exertions such as
sprinting and weight-lifting. Anything that very strenuous. That's not
to say that they shouldn't exercise. Light exercise is encouraged, but
this would be activities like light jogging, swimming laps, or biking.

In order to minimize aortic shear stress, a resting heart rate of under
70 beats per minute and an exercising heart rate under 100 should be the
goal. This can be accomplished with beta blockers. Propranolol has been
shown to significantly decrease the rate of aortic growth in Marfans
patients with a baseline aortic root diameter under 4cm. There is
research into the use of Losartan in murine models that suggests it
inhibits TGF-beta in the aortic wall, which is an important pathway that
contributes to the breakdown of the wall. However, randomized controlled
studies have failed to show an increased benefit of Losartan over beta
blockers in Marfans patients. ACE inhibitors are also being tested and
are shown to decrease the risk of type b aortic dissection over 6 years.

In vascular EDS instead of propranolol, celiprolol has been studied by
the French and shown to reduce vascular rupture from 50 down to 20\% in
vEDS, although the mechanism of this is not yet clear and does not
appear to be necessarily the same as decreasing shear stress as in
Marfan's syndrome.(Ong et al. 2010) In general taking care of these
patients involves trying to minimize complications from procedures and
interventions. For instance, use ultrasound for any line that is
necessary and avoid arterial lines, intramuscular injections, or other
invasive lines if possible to minimize the chance of a complication.
Patients are advised to wear medical bracelets notifying that they have
vEDS.

We also discuss the importance of forming a care team based on their
needs. This usually includes a cardiologist, a cardiac surgeon, a
vascular surgeon, and a primary care physician.

\hypertarget{surgery-1}{%
\subsection{Surgery}\label{surgery-1}}

\textbf{What about surgical treatment for those who need it?}

For patients with Marfan's, prophylactic surgery is recommended for
aortic root dilation \textgreater5cm or thoracic aorta
\textgreater5.5cm. Often times the thoracic and abdominal aorta are
involved. Open and endovascular surgery are options for these patients.
Open procedures often include open thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm
repairs, open cardiac surgery for arch replacement, or cervical
debranching procedures. Endovascular procedures can include regular
TEVARs or branched TEVARs which require extensive aortic coverage.

Open surgery can be well tolerated and is ideal in the sense that you
can replace the entire aorta which avoids the future complications from
continued aneurysmal degeneration, loss of proximal or distal seal
zones, or device issues that can plague endovascular methods. However
open surgery, of course caries higher complication risk and morbidity up
front and does share some complications with endovascular treatments as
well.

Sometimes these patients will have hybrid procedures and often their
care will require multiple surgery teams including cardiac and vascular
surgery. An important thing to be up front with all of these patients
about is that this is a long term relationship with their surgeon, as
they often require multiple staged procedures, things aren't fixed in
one procedure, and even after they have been surgically addressed there
is a lifetime of maintenance and surveillance.

Ultimately, the decision for open vs.~endovascular approaches will vary
between patients based on their specific anatomy and arterial issues,
what their body can tolerate, and ultimately what their goals of care
are.(Lum, Brooke, Arnaoutakis, et al. 2012) Some may require having
their entire aorta replaced, while others may only need ongoing medical
therapy and surveillance and it's important to set expectations early.

\textbf{What about VEDS, when surgery cannot be avoided? How do you
mitigate the risk of complications?}

The tissue is very fragile. So using instruments that are the least
traumatic is key -- like fogarty clamps for vessels. Sutures often must
be pledgeted to reinforce them. Leave no tension on anastomoses or
suture lines. Always keep a backup plan in mind-- when arteries cannot
be repaired, can they safely be ligated or embolized. Generally any
large bore access for endovascular treatment is avoided because access
site complications are high and can lead to devastating consequences.
Some have described a technique of open exposure and buttressed repair,
when endovascular approaches are required.(Black 2019)

In situations of extremis, like a rupture, these patients' tissues have
been known to completely breakdown. This is often their first
presentation of their aortopathy so there is no time for previously
discussed work up or considerations. Try to avoid the worst case
scenario, but of course sometimes it's the only option left to get out
of the OR. Be upfront with the patient about how complications may
arise, set expectations, and think about goals of care early.

Some specific considerations for TEVAR in these patients is that it may
be important to have cardiac surgery readily available because they are
high risk for retrograde dissection. Also, avoid aggressive oversizing,
consider not ballooning if no leak is identified and avoid excessive
wire manipulation.

\hypertarget{summary-1}{%
\section{Summary}\label{summary-1}}

\textbf{We discussed earlier that these aortopathies can have shared
phenotypic characteristics, some of which can be used in a clinical
diagnosis, but are all of these genetic aortopathies syndromic?}

Let's start by saying that all patients with Marfan syndrome and VEDS
can have the syndromic features we just talked about. However, it's not
always the case and the absence of these feature does not exclude the
diagnosis. In fact, we recently treated a middle-aged woman with an
aortic dissection who had Marfan Syndrome confirmed with genetic
testing. She had been diagnosed prior to her dissection because her
daughter had undergone genetic testing. However, on meeting her, I would
not have guessed she had Marfan Syndrome, had I not known. She was
average height, obese, and had no other relevant physical findings on
exam or history.

This ties into another genetic aortopathy that we have not discussed yet
which are the familial thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections. They
do not have any syndromic features. For example, patients with ACTA2
pathogenic variants that cause alpha actin mutations which again
contribute to degeneration of the arterial wall. These patients tend to
present 10 years younger than sporadic thoracic aortic aneurysms,
generally in their late 50s compared to late 60s, and women seem to be
less often effected than men.

\textbf{Dr.~Shalhub, I know vascular genetics is one of your passions.
Is there anything else you want people to remember from this broadcast?}

Don't forget the family. Once you've made the diagnosis in one of them,
remember it is autosomal dominant, so it's important to make sure the
family understands and that they are set up with the appropriate care
team and monitoring. They may not all develop the same medical issues,
however as we discussed, ongoing medical management and lifestyle
changes are the key.

\subsection{Management}\label{management-14}}

\textbf{Overview}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Endovascular repair of BTAI has better outcomes than Open repair
\item
  Need to consider that most TEVAR devices are designed for aneurysmal
  disease

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Generally require a larger diameter and their compliance is not
    ideal for these smaller/normal caliber aortic arch sizes
  \item
    Average size of aorta proximal to injury site is 19mm (smallest
    devices are at 22mm)
  \item
    Previously, iliac devices used to treat aortic injuries
  \end{itemize}
\item
  There are new advanced TEVAR devices that are available for
  non-aneurysmal disease with normal caliber aortic sizes.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    ex: GORE TAG Conformable Thoracic Stent Graft with ACTIVE CONTROL
    System
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Recommend heparinization if not contraindicated

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    i.e.~TBI, femoral shaft fracture with hematoma, solid organ injury,
    etc.
  \item
    TEVAR can still be performed safely without heparin
  \item
    Higher threshold for heparinization in COVID+ patients due to their
    hypercoagulable state
  \item
    Goal Activated Clotting Time (ACT) \textgreater{} 250 - Ensure that
    ACT machine is available prior to start of case
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Methods of Endograft Size Measurement}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  CTA imaging

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Used to help measure aortic size
  \item
    Need to consider that patient is usually hypovolemic, constricted,
    and young (so aorta more compliant/elastic) --- true aortic size may
    be under-represented, 40\% discrepancy between pre- and
    post-resuscitation, on imaging when choosing the appropriate device
    for repair
  \item
    Recommend over-sizing stent graft by 20-25\% from original
    measurement
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    During angiogram, can confirm or redirect sizing in real-time during
    systole(Azizzadeh et al. 2011; Shi et al. 2015)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Access}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  If iliac size is \textgreater7-8 mm, can use transfemoral access
\item
  Small iliacs (\textless{} 6mm) may need conduits

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Recommend retroperitoneal approach for exposing common femoral
    and/or external iliac and using a Dacron conduit(F. J. Criado 2007)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  If iliacs are diseased (i.e.~calcium burden), use of conduits would be
  difficult

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Can consider putting mineral oil over sheath to help pass and
    deliver the endograft
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Femoral cutdowns considered to ensure safe delivery and removal of
  device
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Positioning of Device}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Most important aspect is to cover the proximal defect and seal the
  entry point
\item
  Average distance between the injury and the LSA is approximately 5.8mm
  (located at aortic isthmus)
\item
  Recommend 2cm coverage proximally of healthy vessel and 2cm coverage
  distally

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    With these recommendations, approximately 40\% of TEVAR repairs
    cover the LSA
  \item
    Preemptive revascularization of LSA is not necessarily required,
    most patients do fine without arm claudication

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Complications to consider when covering LSA

      \begin{itemize}
      \item
        Stroke

        \begin{itemize}
        \item
          If there is concern for vertebral perfusion, LSA must be
          revascularized prior to covering
        \item
          Left vertebral artery may be dominant or significant disease
          in right vertebral artery
        \end{itemize}
      \item
        Arm claudication and ischemia
      \item
        Spinal cord ischemia

        \begin{itemize}
        \item
          Rare
        \item
          Collateral pathways between LSA and IMA (internal mammary
          artery) can be compromised
        \item
          Spinal cord ischemia can present at end of case or delayed
          24-72 hours post-operatively
        \item
          Spinal cord drainage not routinely done to prevent paraplegia
          unless there is concern if abnormal neuro-exam.

          \begin{itemize}
          \item
            If abnormal neuro exam at the end of the case, elevate blood
            pressure to improve perfusion and consider placing a drain
            at that time
          \item
            There is high risk of placing and monitoring drains if not
            needed
          \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
      \end{itemize}
    \item
      Relative contraindications to covering LSA without
      revascularization

      \begin{itemize}
      \item
        Dominant Left Vertebral Artery perfusion to brain
      \item
        Right Vertebral Artery atherosclerotic disease
      \item
        Hemodialysis access on ipsilateral arm
      \item
        Prior CABG with LIMA (left internal mammary) to LAD (left
        anterior descending artery)
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Some devices (i.e.~GORE conformable as above) allow control of first
  stent ring to better conform/lay down the stent within the arch
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Dealing with Malpositioned Devices}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Can deploy too proximal or too distal
\item
  ``Bird Beaking'' - Where the lesser curve of the graft is not well
  approximated to the lesser curve of the aorta (i.e.~the lifting of the
  inferior aspect of the most proximal endograft with the first covered
  stent ring now lifted off into the inner curve of the aortic
  arch)(Frohlich et al. 2020) This can cause endoleaks. Methods to avoid
  ``bird beaking''

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Use stiff wire to get into the aortic root (i.e.~Amplatz or
    Lunderquist wires) with forward pressure to have a constant tension
  \item
    Wire should be snug against the greater curvature of the aorta
  \item
    Can consider taking the graft over the origin of the LSA
  \item
    Allows more room in the flatter inner arch to lay the graft down
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Timing of Repair}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  SVS Grade 3 or Harborview Classification of Moderate Injury

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Delayed repair 24-48 hours after injury is acceptable and there is a
    survivable benefit(Alarhayem et al. 2021)
  \item
    Some delays can be up to 5-7 days with medical management
  \item
    Allows time for operative planning and optimization with
    anti-impulse therapy/resuscitation
  \item
    Also enables evaluation of any underlying infectious process that
    may compromise and infect the endograft
  \end{itemize}
\item
  SVS Grade 4 or Evolving SVS Grade 3/Harborview Moderate injuries

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    More urgent repair (within 24 hours)

\textbf{Overview}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Zone 1 and 3 can be repaired endovascularly (above the SMA and below
  the renal arteries)
\item
  Can cover the celiac artery safely if there is no obvious compromise
  of the other mesenteric arteries (i.e.~inferior mesenteric artery,
  internal iliac arteries, prior gastrectomy or other complex
  intra-abdominal operation)(Banno et al. 2020)
\item
  Zone 2 injuries typically repaired with open approach
\item
  Endovascular approach can minimize risk of contamination if there is
  bowel spillage etc.
\item
  Want to use minimum amount of endograft that will appropriately cover
  injury 2cm coverage proximally and 2 cm coverage distally
\item
  Injury can sometimes result in occlusion, which can also be treated
  endovascularly.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Types of Endografts Used} - Can use combination of all grafts
types to get the appropriate coverage

\begin{itemize}
\item
  TEVARs
\item
  Covered stents
\item
  Aortic cuffs

Epidemiology

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Very rare, 9\% of all vascular trauma
\item
  Low incidence due to protection of vessels from surrounding bony
  structures and high degree of exsanguination with devastating injuries
\item
  Endovascular repair preferred due to location of these injuries and
  highly morbid open repair due to central hemorrhage and risk of
  brachial plexus injury.(Branco et al. 2016; DuBose et al. 2012)
\item
  Difficult to access via open methods with proximal/distal control due
  to protective anatomic nature of overlying skeleton
\end{itemize}

Anatomy

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Thoracic Outlet

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Axillo-subclavian vein located anterior to anterior scalene and runs
    between the first rib and clavicle through the subclavius
    muscle/tendon
  \item
    Axillo-subclavian artery is located in the arterial triangle

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      More lateral than the axillo-subclavian vein
    \item
      Courses posteriorly to anterior scalene
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{management-16}{%

\textbf{Access}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Transbrachial or transradial access preferred
\item
  Can combine transbrachial and transfemoral

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Provides more options for delivering stent grafts with difficult
    aortic arches (anterograde and retrograde approach) via a through
    wire
  \end{itemize}
\item
  With transbrachial access, brachial cutdown can be more reliable in
  trauma setting
\item
  Can also consider HYBRID approach

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Gain proximal and distal control via through wires from
    transbrachial/transradial and then perform the open repair
  \item
    Can perform coil embolization of subclavian arteries to gain control

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Caution to vertebral perfusion
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Stent graft to temporize injury and maintain in-line flow, then have
    interval axillary artery repair with a bypass (within a week to a
    month later)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Types of Endografts used}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Self-expanding stents (i.e.~Viabahn)

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Traditional approach
  \item
    May provide greater flexibility - important for mid-subclavian
    penetrating trauam due to mobility of this region. Stents in the
    axilla have particularly poor patency for this reason.(Chopra et al.
    2016; Gray et al. 2017; Shalhub et al. 2011)
  \item
    Helpful for more distal injuries
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Balloon-expandable stents

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Newer devices, also flexible
  \item
    Has more precise landing (especially if injury is near branch
    points)

\textbf{What is an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)?} (Moore, Lawrence,
and Oderich 2019)

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Defined as a localized dilation of an artery to a diameter greater
  than 50\% (1.5x) of its normal diameter. It is generally accepted that
  \textgreater3cm in adults is considered aneurysmal for the abdominal
  aorta.
\item
  AAAs can be described as:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Infrarenal -- distal to the renal arteries with normal aorta between
    the renal arteries and the aneurysm origin.
  \item
    Juxtarenal -- aneurysm extends to the renal arteries but does not
    involve them
  \item
    Pararenal -- aneurysm involving the origin of at least one of the
    renal arteries
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Estimated 1.1 million Americans have AAAs, which equates to a
  prevalence of 1.4\% in 50-84 year old general population.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Men 65-75y with a history of smoking have a prevalence of 6-7\% -
    hence the need for screening.(LeFevre and Force 2014; Chaikof,
    Dalman, Eskandari, Jackson, Lee, Mansour, Mastracci, Mell, Murad,
    Nguyen, and al. 2018)
  \item
    Men without a history of smoking have a prevalence of 2\%.
  \item
    Women who are current smokers 2\%, and women with a history of
    smoking 0.8\%.(Wanhainen et al. 2006)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  AAAs are 3-7x more prevalent than thoracic aortic aneurysms and can
  co-exist with other aneurysms throughout the arterial vascular system
  like popliteal artery aneurysms.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    In a 10-year review originating from Ireland, 50\% of patients that
    presented with unilateral popliteal artery aneurysms had associated
    AAA. In patients with bilateral popliteal aneurysms, 63\% of those
    had associated AAA. (Duffy et al. 1998)
  \item
    Patients with femoral aneurysms have an 85\% chance of an associated
    AAA. (Diwan et al. 2000a)
  \item
    Conversely, if a patient is first found to have a AAA, there is an
    11\% chance of having associated popliteal artery aneurysms
    \textgreater15mm. (Tuveson, Löfdahl, and Hultgren 2016)
  \item
    Another study showed a rate of femoral-popliteal aneurysms in AAA
    patients is approximately 14\%. (Diwan et al. 2000a)
  \item
    This association stresses the importance of a good physical exam
    when evaluating a patient with a AAA and is commonly tested on
    exams.(Chaikof, Dalman, Eskandari, Jackson, Lee, Mansour, Mastracci,
    Mell, Murad, Nguyen, and al. 2018; Diwan et al. 2000b)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{etiology-4}{%
\subsection{Etiology}\label{etiology-4}}

\textbf{What is the pathogenesis of an abdominal aortic aneurysm?}
(Moore, Lawrence, and Oderich 2019)

\begin{itemize}
\item
  More than 90\% of AAAs are associated with atherosclerosis.
\item
  Other causes include cystic medial necrosis, dissection, Marfan's
  syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Loeys-Dietz, HIV and syphilis.
\item
  Elastin and collagen are the major structural proteins responsible for
  the integrity of the aortic wall and defects in these cause
  degeneration and further aneurysmal change.
\item
  For example, a mutation in fibrillin in Marfan's syndrome causes
  elastin fragmentation and pathological remodeling of the wall of the
  artery to form cystic medial degeneration.
\item
  Several investigations have also shown that upregulation of
  metalloproteinase activity, specifically MMP-2 and MMP-9, have an
  essential role in aneurysm formation. Imbalances between aortic wall
  proteases and antiproteases cause degradation of the extracellular
  matrix and loss of structural integrity of the aortic wall.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Nicotine increases MMP expression in vascular smooth muscle
    cells.(Z.-Z. Li and Dai 2012; Rabkin 2016)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Increased thrombus burden is associated with wall thinning, medial
  loss of smooth muscle cells, elastin degradation, adventitial
  inflammation and aortic wall hypoxia which all increase the rate of
  AAA growth.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Of note, intraluminal thrombus rarely embolizes and is not an
    indication for anticoagulation.(Singh et al. 2019; Cameron, Russell,
    and Owens 2018)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Infective aortitis is a rare but highly morbid cause for aortic
  aneurysm formation. Treatment in this setting should be more
  aggressive with the addition of antibiotic therapy and open surgical
  repair with rifampin soaked graft whenever feasible.(Gornik and
  Creager 2008; Paravastu et al. 2009; T. E. Rasmussen and Hallett 1997)
\item
  For more about aortitis, see Section~\ref{sec-large-vasculitis}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What are the risk factors for AAA occurrence and growth?}
(Moore, Lawrence, and Oderich 2019)

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Risk factors for AAAs are similar to the risk factors for occlusive
  atherosclerosis and include age, tobacco use, hypertension, male
  gender and hyperlipidemia.
\item
  Cigarette smoking is the single most important modifiable risk factor
  to prevent occurrence and growth of AAAs. Smoking increases the rate
  of growth by 35\% for abdominal aortic aneurysms.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Smoking has a dose dependent relationship with AAA, smoking 1/2 ppd
    has one third the risk of smoking 1 ppd.(Kent et al. 2010)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  It has been found that diabetes is protective for AAA progression and
  rupture.
\item
  Men more likely to have AAA, but women develop at a later age with
  more aggressive growth and risk for rupture. (Lo and Schermerhorn
  2016a)

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Stronger association with smoking in women.
  \item
    Women have same outcomes from endo repair, higher complications from
    open repair due to poorly managed CV risk factors.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Fluoroquinolones(C.-C. Lee et al. 2015, 2018; LeMaire et al. 2018;
  Pasternak, Inghammar, and Svanström 2018) - In a recent study just
  published in JAMA Surgery in January 2021, the group at UNC showed an
  increased short-term risk of developing an aortic aneurysm with
  fluoroquinolone use. (Newton et al. 2021)

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    They reviewed all prescription fills for fluoroquinolones or
    comparative antibiotics from 2005-2017.
  \item
    This included \textgreater27 million US Adults aged 18-64 years old
    with no history of aneurysms.
  \item
    18\% of the prescriptions were fluoroquinolones.
  \item
    Fluoroquinolones were associated with increased incidence of aortic
    aneurysms. Compared to the other antibiotics, fluoroquinolones were
    associated with a higher 90-day incidence of AAA and iliac aneurysms
    as well as more likely to undergo aneurysm repair.
  \item
    They recommended that fluoroquinolone use should be pursued with
    caution in all adults, not just high risk individuals, and they
    recommended broadening of the warnings from the FDA.
  \item
    Fluoroquinolones playing a role in dissections and aneurysm
    formation is often a highly tested question
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Medical therapy has been studied with disappointing results.
  Beta-blockers and ACE/ARB inhibitors have been studied but have not
  shown any effect on growth of AAAs.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What is the dreaded complication of AAA?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Aneurysm rupture is the fear with a diagnosis of AAA. The risk of
  rupture increases yearly as the aneurysm expands. Once an aneurysm
  develops, it tends to enlarge gradually yet progressively. This is an
  important concept to grasp for testing.(Lindsay 2019a; Tracci, Roy,
  and Upchurch, n.d.)
\item
  Growth rate

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    For smaller aneurysms (3-5cm in size), the growth rate is
    approximately 2-3mm/year
  \item
    For larger aneurysms (\textgreater5cm), the growth rate is higher at
    3-5mm/year.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Rupture risk, historically, has been described as:
\end{itemize}

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}cc@{}}

    rupture risks were far lower than previously reported and what is

\end{longtable}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Factors that increase the risk of rupture other than the size of the
  aneurysm are smoking, COPD, hypertension, transplant recipient, and
  rapid enlargement (defined as 1 cm/year or more).
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{evaluation-10}{%
\section{Evaluation}\label{evaluation-10}}

\textbf{What is the work up for a AAA?} (Moore, Lawrence, and Oderich
2019)

\begin{itemize}
\item
  75\% of all infrarenal AAAs are asymptomatic when first detected and
  often incidentally discovered on unrelated imaging.
\item
  Symptoms - Some patients may report symptoms such as abdominal, flank
  or back pain from pressure on adjacent somatic sensory nerves or
  overlying peritoneum. Tenderness by itself is not a reliable indicator
  of impending rupture. Other symptoms include thrombosis and distal
  embolization.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{imaging-1}{%
\subsection{Imaging}\label{imaging-1}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Ultrasound, when feasible, is the preferred imaging modality for
  aneurysm screening and surveillance.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) recommends a one-time
    ultrasound screening in men and women ages 65 to 75 years with
    either a history of smoking or a family history of AAA, as well as
    men and women over the age of 75 with a smoking history in otherwise
    good health who have not previously undergone screening. (Chaikof,
    Dalman, Eskandari, Jackson, Lee, Mansour, Mastracci, Mell, Murad,
    Nguyen, Oderich, et al. 2018)
  \item
    For more technical details on duplex screening see
    Section~\ref{sec-lab-aorta}.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}cc@{}}

\end{longtable}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  It is important to note that these screening guidelines are Level 2,
  Grade C evidence from the SVS.
\item
  Traditionally, once duplex reveals an aneurysm 5cm in size, an initial
  CTA is performed and patients are followed with additional CT scans to
  assist with operative planning.
\item
  CT angiograms are helpful in operative planning and determining
  candidacy for EVAR. You can assess the relationship of the aneurysm to
  the renal arteries, assess the access vessels, and measure seal zones

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The maximum aneurysm diameter derived from the CTA should be based
    on outer wall to outer wall measurement perpendicular to the path of
    the aorta (the center-line of the aneurysm).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  MRA is recommended for patients with renal insufficiency who cannot
  tolerate iodinated contrast.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{management-17}{%
\section{Management}\label{management-17}}

\textbf{What are the indications for repair?} (Moore, Lawrence, and
Oderich 2019)

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The current recommendation to repair a fusiform aneurysm is 5.5cm for
  men (\emph{Level 1, Grade A evidence}), 5.0cm for women as they have a
  higher risk for rupture, and rapid growth (\textgreater5mm over 6
  months). (Chaikof, Dalman, Eskandari, Jackson, Lee, Mansour,
  Mastracci, Mell, Murad, Nguyen, Oderich, et al. 2018)
\item
  For saccular aneurysms, the SVS practice guidelines recommend elective
  repair (\emph{Level 2, Grade C evidence}). (Chaikof, Dalman,
  Eskandari, Jackson, Lee, Mansour, Mastracci, Mell, Murad, Nguyen,
  Oderich, et al. 2018)

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Studies show equivalent wall stress in saccular aneurysms at much
    smaller sizes when compared to fusiform aneurysms. This has led to
    the notion that they have a higher rupture risk at smaller sizes.
  \item
    A study published in Annals of Vascular Surgery in 2016 showed a
    significant portion of ruptures \textless55mm in size were saccular
    in nature. (Kristmundsson et al. 2016)

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Specific size guidelines for repair are currently lacking because
      of their infrequent presentation.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What are the options for repair, and how do you choose?} (Moore,
Lawrence, and Oderich 2019; Fairman 2019)

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Two options: open repair and endovascular aortic aneurysm repair
  (EVAR).

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    When attempting to decide between the two, one must consider the
    patient's perioperative risk as well as the patient's anatomy, which
    will be reviewed further here.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  When reviewing the patient's risk for surgery, there are many tools to
  assist, which are outlined in the Society for Vascular Surgery's
  practice guidelines.
\item
  The VSGNE or Vascular Study Group of New England developed a risk
  prediction model for mortality which can assist in your decision
  making. This is endorsed by both SVS and the Vascular Quality
  Initiative.(Chaikof, Dalman, Eskandari, Jackson, Lee, Mansour,
  Mastracci, Mell, Murad, Nguyen, and al. 2018; Eslami et al. 2015)

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    This risk model looks at open vs endovascular repair and further
    delineates infrarenal vs suprarenal clamps
  \item
    It includes aneurysm sizes with 6.5cm as the cut off.
  \item
    It includes age above or below 75yo.
  \item
    Gender and comorbidities are included like heart disease,
    cerebrovascular disease and COPD.
  \item
    An important risk factor is also renal function which is delineated
    by creatinine at 1.5-2 or \textgreater2.
  \item
    Each of these risk factors is assigned a point grading.
  \item
    These points are added together and they place the patient on a
    spectrum of mortality risk. Depending on the amount of points
    accumulated, the risk is divided into low, medium, high or
    prohibitively high-risk groups
  \item
    This is something that can help both the patient and physician in
    deciding on surgery and how to proceed.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Recent studies have shown that decreased aerobic fitness and high
  frailty score predicted increased morbidity and mortality after open
  aneurysm repair.
\item
  High-risk patients are defined by the following in the SVS guidelines:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Unstable angina or angina at rest
  \item
    Congestive heart failure with EF \textless{} 25-30\%
  \item
    Serum creatinine level \textgreater{} 3 mg/dL
  \item
    Pulmonary disease manifested by room air PaO2 \textless{} 50 mmHg,
    elevated PCO2, or both.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  To help delineate a patient's risk, a preoperative workup is
  necessary. The SVS practice guidelines recommend the following:
  (Chaikof, Dalman, Eskandari, Jackson, Lee, Mansour, Mastracci, Mell,
  Murad, Nguyen, Oderich, et al. 2018)

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Determine if the patient has an active cardiovascular condition.
    Coronary artery disease is responsible for at least 50\% to 60\% of
    perioperative and late deaths after operations on the abdominal
    aorta, therefore, it is important for patients to undergo cardiac
    evaluation prior to surgery.

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Unstable angina, decompensated heart failure, severe valvular
      disease, significant arrhythmia -\textgreater{} Cardiology
      consultation (\emph{Level 1, Grade B})
    \item
      Significant clinical risk factors such as coronary artery disease,
      congestive heart failure, stroke, diabetes mellitus, and chronic
      kidney disease -\textgreater{} Stress test (\emph{Level 2, Grade
      B})
    \item
      Worsening dyspnea -\textgreater{} Echocardiogram (\emph{Level 1,
      Grade A})
    \item
      All patients undergoing EVAR or open repair require EKG
    \item
      In patients capable of moderate physical activities, such as
      climbing two flights of stairs or running a short distance (MET
      \textgreater= 4), there is no benefit in further testing.
    \item
      If coronary intervention is required, this takes precedence over
      aneurysm repair.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    History of COPD

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Pulmonary function test with ABG (\emph{Level 2, Grade C})
    \item
      Smoking cessation for at least 2 weeks prior (\emph{Level 1, Grade
      C})
    \item
      Pulmonary bronchodilators at least 2 weeks before aneurysm repair
      (\emph{Level 2, Grade C})
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  In patients who are deemed high risk, EVAR is the most attractive
  option in anatomically suitable patients
\item
  Morbidity and mortality rates are lower for EVAR than open repair in
  the short term. This is illustrated in multiple studies.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    The EVAR-1 trial, a randomized prospective UK study including 1082
    patients, compared EVAR with open AAA repair in patients who were
    fit enough to undergo open surgical repair from 1999-2003. The
    30-day mortality rate was reduced in the EVAR group (1.7\% vs
    4.7\%), although secondary interventions were more common in the
    EVAR group (9.8\% vs.~5.8\%). (R. Greenhalgh 2004)
  \item
    The DREAM trial, a multicenter randomized trial from 2000-2003,
    compared EVAR vs Open repair in 345 patients with a reduction in
    operative mortality (4.7\% vs 9.8\%) with the majority of
    complications accounted for by pulmonary issues. (Prinssen, Cuypers,
    and Buskens 2004)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  This early survival benefit with EVAR over open repair disappears by
  the third postoperative year.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The Open vs Endovascular Repair (OVER) trial included 881 patients
    from 42 VA centers randomized to either EVAR or open repair. This
    demonstrated that perioperative mortality was improved in the EVAR
    group (0.5\% vs 3.0\%), yet no statistically significant difference
    was seen in mortality at 2 years (7.0\% vs 9.8\%). (Lederle et al.
    2019)

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Late mortality seems to be higher in EVAR due to ruptures from
  endoleaks that do not occur in open repair. (Rajendran and May 2017)
\end{itemize}

Reviewing the anatomic criteria for traditional infrarenal EVAR may rule
out EVAR as an option in some patients. These criteria vary slightly
depending on the particular device being used.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Neck}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    A neck length of at least 10-15mm from the renal arteries to the
    aneurysm start with a diameter of 18-32mm.
  \item
    It is important that the neck is relatively free of thrombus or
    calcification to decrease the risk of endoleaks.
  \item
    Infrarenal necks 4-15mm would require fenestrated endovascular
    repair. The only FDA approved device for fenestrated repairs is the
    Cook Z-Fen device.(Gustavo S. Oderich et al. 2014)

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Z-fen requires diameter 19-31mm, angle \textless45deg angle to
      long axis of aneurysm, ipsilateral iliac fixation \textgreater30mm
      and 9-21mm in diam, contralateral iliac \textgreater30mm and
      7-21mm diam. Multiple or early branching renal arteries can limit
      this reapir as well. (Gustavo S. Oderich, Correa, and Mendes 2014)
    \item
      Parallel grafts for short necks (i.e.~snorkel or chimney) require
      20mm seal for good outcomes. (Donas et al. 2015)
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

episode} where Dr.~Wes Jones and Murray Shames review their technique
for performing a Zfen endovascular aortic anuerysm repair. This
technique is beyond the scope of this review.

\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Angulation

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Neck angulation should be \textless{} 60 degrees for current devices
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Access vessels

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Access vessels must be adequate for delivery of the device depending
    on the sheath size required (6-8mm)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Aortic bifurcation

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The aortic bifurcation must be \textgreater20mm in size to
    accommodate the graft opening to full caliber
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Iliac landing zone

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Adequate seal zone in the distal common iliac arteries of 10-15mm in
    length and diameter of 7.5-25mm.
  \item
    If covering the hypogastric arteries is necessary unilaterally to
    obtain a seal, you can embolize the hypogastric artery (to prevent
    retrograde flow) and extend the graft into the external iliac
    artery.
  \item
    If this is an issue bilaterally, an iliac branch device can assist
    in maintaining perfusion into the hypogastric arteries.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Special considerations

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Aortocaval fistula - sometimes aneurysms can be complicated by fistula
  with the IVC. This can occur with primary fistula, rupture and after
  repair. This is rare, 1\% in elective AAA and 6\% in
  rupture.(Brightwell, Pegna, and Boyne 2013; R. Schmidt et al. 1994)
  High risk of persistent endoleak due to ongoing flow into IVC. Open
  repair often best.(Orion, Beaulieu, and Black 2016)
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{evar}{%
\subsection{EVAR}\label{evar}}

\textbf{Can you briefly go over the steps of an EVAR?} (Moore, Lawrence,
and Oderich 2019)

EVAR now accounts for approximately 70-80\% of elective abdominal aortic
aneurysm repairs and 65\% of iliac aneurysm repairs in the United States
and many other countries.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Performed in the operating room or IR suite with a fixed or portable
  C-arm
\item
  Anesthesia

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Regional block, local anesthesia or general anesthesia depending on
    surgeon preference and patient risk
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Groin access and short sheath placement

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Percutaneous - Closure devices are introduced prior to inserting the
    large sheaths containing the stent-grafts
  \item
    Cut-down
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Pigtail catheter is used to perform an aortogram of the abdominal
  aorta and iliac arteries
\item
  The renal artery orifices are marked. If there is any concern about
  good visualization, IVUS (intravascular ultrasound) can be used to
  assist.
\item
  Systemic heparin is given
\item
  Bilateral femoral sheaths are exchanged over a stiff wire for the
  necessary sheaths required for the device size chosen.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Main trunk and ipsilateral limb sheath on one side
  \item
    Contralateral limb sheath on the other side
  \end{itemize}
\item
  The main body is positioned in the proximal neck and a repeat
  angiogram is commonly performed to confirm the positioning of the
  device at the desired level just below the lowest renal artery. It is
  best to position the main body so that the gate is directed at the
  simplest angle to cannulate.
\item
  The main body is deployed to the point where the gate is opened
\item
  Contralateral limb gate cannulation is performed using a wire and
  directional catheter.
\item
  Once in the gate, a pigtail catheter is formed within the main body
  and must be able to spin freely 360 degrees to confirm placement
  within the endograft. There are multiple techniques to confirm that
  the wire is in the endograft, but this MUST be confirmed before
  proceeding to deploy the contralateral limb.
\item
  The contralateral limb is introduced and deployed taking care to
  preserve flow to the internal iliac artery.
\item
  The remainder of the main body is deployed and iliac extensions
  deployed if required.
\item
  The stent graft is ballooned at the neck, within the gate, at the
  bifurcation, and distal iliac seal zones.
\item
  An aortogram, usually multiple in different views, is performed to
  exclude any endoleaks.
\item
  The sheaths are removed, and the groin sites are closed using Perclose
  devices if performed percutaneously, or primary repair if open cutdown
  performed.
\item
  Check pedal signals at the end of the case to ensure no thromboembolic
  events or femoral artery access injuries have occurred. If there is
  concern, an ultrasound duplex can be performed intraoperatively.

\textbf{You mentioned endoleaks, can you discuss the complications
specific to EVAR and the management?} (Moore, Lawrence, and Oderich
2019)

\begin{itemize}
\item
  15 year follow up from EVAR-1 shows inferior late survival and higher
  re-intervention in EVAR patients when compared with open repair. (R.
  Patel et al. 2016)
\item
  Many of the cardiopulmonary complications inherent with open repair do
  not occur with EVAR as there is no aortic cross clamping.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    In a study from Mayo clinic evaluating elective infrarenal AAA
    repairs from 1999 to 2001, Elkouri et al found that cardiac and
    pulmonary morbidity after EVAR was drastically reduced compared to
    open repair (11\% vs 22\% and 3\% vs 16\%, respectively). (Elkouri
    et al. 2004)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Risk of ischemic colitis remains as the IMA is covered with EVAR. It
  is lower than with open repair but remains 1-2\%.
\item
  Renal insufficiency may occur secondary to contrast administration in
  a patient with underlying chronic kidney disease. Thromboembolic
  events may occur from thrombus-laden aortic necks with wire and device
  manipulation to the renal arteries as well.
\item
  Iliac limb occlusion - can occur within hours of EVAR (3-5\%). Risk
  factors included iliac artery tortuosity, calcified plaque burden or
  occlusive disease, external iliac artery dissection(Vacirca et al.
  2019), inadequate outflow due to access site complication. Post
  operative CFA duplex will show dampened waveforms.(R. M. Greenhalgh et
  al. 2010; Taudorf et al. 2014)
\item
  Emergent conversion from EVAR to open are associated with significant
  increase in morbidity and mortality. Risk factors include aneurysm
  diameter, young age, female gender and nonwhite race.(Ultee et al.
  2016a)
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{endoleak}{%
\subsubsection{Endoleak}\label{endoleak}}

Defined as persistent blood flow within the aneurysm sac following EVAR.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Type I

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    A leak at the graft ends secondary to inadequate seal proximally
    (1a) or distally (1b)
  \item
    If identified intraoperatively, Type I endoleaks require attention
    with further balloon angioplasty, proximal or distal extension, or
    endoanchors.

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Use of endoanchors in thrombus and calcium-laden aorta is not
      recommended.(Jordan et al. 2014) Outcomes are similar with or
      without suprarenal fixation.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    If seen in follow up surveillance, intervention is necessary.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Type II

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Sac filling secondary to retrograde filling via a branch vessel off
    of the aneurysm sac such as a lumbar artery or the IMA
  \item
    If identified intraoperatively, this typically does not need to be
    addressed in the OR. Typically, type II endoleaks spontaneously
    thrombose and therefore can be observed.
  \item
    It is common to continue monitoring even if there is persistent flow
    as long as there is no aneurysm sac growth. Type II endoleaks
    persist in 5-25\% of patients. Risk factors for persistent endoleak
    include anticoagulation(Bobadilla et al. 2010),
    patency/number/diameter of IMA/lumbar arteries(T. J. Ward et al.
    2014), hypogastric coil embolization, distal graft extension,
    absence of COPD, age \textgreater80yrs, and graft type. Risk of
    rupture is 1.5-3\%.(Lo and Schermerhorn 2016b; Abularrage et al.
    2010; Timaran et al. 2004; Shalaby et al. 2016; Sarac et al. 2012;
    J. E. Jones et al. 2007)
  \item
    If the leak persists for \textgreater{} 6 months with sac
    enlargement \textgreater5mm, intervention is recommended. Several
    techniques exist to eliminate type II endoleaks, most frequently
    embolization. After multiple attempts at repair and if continued sac
    growth with impending Type I leak, then consider open
    conversion.(Kelso et al. 2009; Mohapatra et al. 2019)

management of endograft failures and some techniques for open conversion
that are a little beyond the details of this review.

\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Type III

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Separation of graft components. Treated by relining the EVAR graft.
  \item
    Usually identified in follow-up surveillance and necessitates
    intervention.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Type IV

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Secondary to a porous graft which typically does not occur any
    longer as endograft material and devices have improved. If seen, no
    intervention is needed at the time, and they usually thrombose on
    their own.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Type V

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Increasing aneurysm sac size with no identifiable endoleak. Commonly
    referred to as endotension.
  \item
    Usually necessitates graft explantation and open repair or re-lining
    of the graft.

\subsection{Open Repair}\label{sec-aaa-open-repair}}

\textbf{Now we can move onto open repair. Describe an open infrarenal
aneurysm repair.} (Moore, Lawrence, and Oderich 2019; Gary G Wind and R.
James Valentine 2013)

After thorough preoperative evaluation and clearance, the patient is
taken back to the operating room. An epidural may be placed
preoperatively depending on institutional preference. The patient is
intubated, and arterial and central venous catheters are placed. The
abdomen is prepped from chest to bilateral thighs.

A cell-saver should be available to optimize resuscitation during the
procedure due to expected large amounts of blood loss. Balanced
resuscitation to prevent coagulopathy is important with significant
blood loss.

Exposure

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Trans-peritoneal or retro-peritoneal. First we will describe the most
  common approach: trans-peritoneal.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Surgical steps}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Mid-line laparotomy, transverse or chevron-style incision
\item
  A retractor system such as an Omni, Bookwalter or Balfour retractor is
  used to assist in exposure depending on physician preference.
\item
  The transverse colon is retracted cephalad, and the small bowel is
  retracted to the patient's right to expose the aorta. The duodenum is
  mobilized and the ligament of Treitz is divided. The posterior
  peritoneum is opened along the anterior wall of the aorta.
\item
  The aneurysm sac is now in view and careful dissection proximally for
  clamp site is achieved. Identification of the left renal vein crossing
  the aorta is key and can be divided if necessary.
\item
  Identification of the renal arteries proximally is required if there
  is a plan for suprarenal clamping.
\item
  Isolate bilateral common iliac arteries for distal clamp site. Use
  caution when dissecting the fibro-areolar tissue overlying the left
  common iliac artery as it contains nerves that control sexual
  function. Damage can result in retrograde ejaculation.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    You can avoid nerve injury with mobilization of the sigmoid colon
    medially and identifying the iliac bifurcation distally, thus
    avoiding transecting the tissue overlying the left common iliac
    artery.
  \item
    If the iliac arteries are severely calcified and pose risk for
    injury with clamping, intraluminal balloon catheters can be inserted
    for distal control instead.
  \item
    Also, you must be cognizant of the location of the ureters crossing
    over the iliac bifurcation to prevent injury.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  After proximal and distal clamp sites have been identified, systemic
  heparin is administered by anesthesia.
\item
  Clamp the distal vessels first to prevent distal embolization.
\item
  Open the aneurysm sac in a longitudinal fashion toward the patient's
  right to avoid the IMA and clear the sac of thrombus. Extend
  proximally to normal aorta and then t off the incision on the aortic
  wall.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Some physicians prefer to transect the aortic wall as opposed to
    leaving the posterior wall intact for the anastomosis.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Lumbar arteries on the posterior wall are ligated using
  figure-of-eight sutures.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Back-bleeding lumbar vessels can be the source of significant blood
    loss.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Graft

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    A tube graft or bifurcated graft depending on the patient's anatomy
    and aortic diameter is chosen. Dacron or PTFE grafts are most
    common, and the choice depends on physician preference. This is
    anastomosed proximally in a continuous fashion.
  \item
    Once complete, the graft is flushed forward to flush out any
    thrombus. The graft is then clamped and the aortic clamp removed to
    test the anastomosis. Repair if needed.
  \item
    The distal anastomosis is completed to the aorta or bilateral iliac
    arteries depending on extent of the aneurysm.
  \item
    The graft is flushed forward prior to completion to remove any
    thrombus within the graft. The anastomosis is completed and clamps
    removed.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Hypotension may occur at this point from re-perfusion of the lower
  extremities and pelvis. Anesthesia should be notified that unclamping
  will occur soon prior to completion of the distal anastomosis to allow
  for fluid resuscitation in preparation.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The graft can be slowly unclamped or partially clamped to assist
    with blood pressure management during this time. You can also place
    manual pressure on the iliac arteries or femoral arteries to slowly
    release flow and avoid significant hypotension.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Next, the IMA must be addressed. The IMA orifice is identified within
  the aneurysm sac.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Chronically occluded or pulsatile back bleeding -\textgreater{}
    ligate.
  \item
    Anything between occlusion and strong pulsatile back bleeding
    requires further evaluation. This should be performed at the end of
    the case after the internal iliacs have been reperfused. Methods to
    measure perfusion:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Place vessel loops or micro bulldog on IMA and assess the sigmoid
      colon. If there is a poor doppler signal on the antimesenteric
      border of the sigmoid colon, the IMA should be reimplanted.
    \item
      Insert blunt-tip needle through the IMA orifice and pull vessel
      loop around needle to secure and connect to a transducer. Pressure
      less than 35 mmHg requires reimplantation. (Hoballah 2021)
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    The Carrel patch technique involves excising a circular button of
    the aortic wall around the IMA and anastomosing it to the graft
    wall.
  \item
    Newer studies have shown that IMA reimplantation does not eliminate
    the risk of ischemic colitis after open AAA repair. In a study out
    of George Washington University in DC published in JVS in 2019,
    there was still significant risk of ischemic colitis rates with IMA
    reimplantation. (K. B. Lee et al. 2019)

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Using NSQIP data collected prospectively and studied
      retrospectively
    \item
      Out of 2397 patients undergoing AAA from 2012-2015, 135 patients
      (5.6\%) had ischemic colitis.
    \item
      672 patients were evaluated further after exclusion criteria
      applied (suprarenal clamp, emergent or ruptured, occluded
      mesenteric vessels)
    \item
      Of these, 637 patients had IMA ligation, 35 had IMA reimplantation
    \item
      Reimplantation was associated with - More frequent return to the
      OR (20\% vs 7.2\%), Higher rates of wound complications (17.1\% vs
      3\%), Higher rates of ischemic colitis (8.6\% vs 2.4\%)
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Difficult to interpret impact of revascularization of IMA on
    ischemic colitis rates, due to selection bias, but should be noted
    that patients who require revascularization still may experience
    colon ischemia.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  To finish, the aneurysm sac is then closed over the graft to protect
  the viscera, and the retro-peritoneum is reapproximated. Occasionally,
  a vascularized omental pedicle flap may be used to separate the graft
  from the duodenum to prevent an aorto-enteric fistula if the
  peritoneum cannot be closed securely.
\end{enumerate}

technique for performing a open AAA repair.

\end{tcolorbox}

\textbf{Steps for the retro-peritoneal approach:}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Positioned semi-lateral with the left side up with bilateral groins
  exposed for femoral artery access. This is done in a lazy lateral
  position where the patients upper body is near complete lateral but
  the hips are rotated to the patient's left in attempt to keep both
  groins in the field in case they need to be accessed.
\item
  An oblique incision extends from the left 11th intercostal space or
  tip of the 12th rib to the edge of the rectus abdominus muscle,
  through the external and internal oblique muscles, transversalis
  fascia until you are just superficial to the peritoneum. Using blunt
  finger dissection, the peritoneum is dissected from the abdominal wall
  posteriorly over the psoas muscle until the aorta is reached.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Benefits include less postoperative ileus, less intraoperative
    hypothermia, lower IV fluid requirements, and less post-op
    respiratory compromise.
  \item
    A disadvantage is the difficulty addressing the right iliac artery
    from this approach. Patients can also develop denervation of the
    lateral abdominal wall and develop a bulge there.

\subsubsection{Complications}\label{complications-3}}

\textbf{What are some of the complications with open aortic aneurysm
repair?} (Moore, Lawrence, and Oderich 2019)

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Recent studies have demonstrated equivalent outcomes in younger
  healthy patients undergoing endovascular and open repair. (Liang et
  al. 2018)
\item
  Myocardial dysfunction which is usually secondary to cardiac ischemia
  or hemorrhage.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Acute conditions associated with poor post-operative cardiac
    outcomes include recent MI (30d), unstable angina, decompensated
    heart failure, high-grade arrhythmias, severe valvular
    disease.(Devereaux and Sessler 2015; Fleisher et al. 2014;
    Kristensen et al. 2014; Tashiro et al. 2014)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Abdominal compartment syndrome secondary to coagulopathic bleeding
  postoperatively or third spacing of fluids can cause abdominal
  compartment syndrome requiring emergent laparotomy.(Cheatham et al.
  2007; Mehta et al. 2005; T. E. Rasmussen and Hallett 1997)

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Signs include unexplained oliguria, difficulty maintaining adequate
    ventilation--elevated peak inspiratory pressure, and hypotension
    with significant abdominal distension is concerning for abdominal
    compartment syndrome. A sustained bladder pressure \textgreater{} 25
    mmHg with associated organ dysfunction (elevated peak airway
    pressures, new onset acute renal failure) is indicative of abdominal
    compartment syndrome.
  \item
    Abdominal compartment syndrome can still occur after EVAR during an
    aortic rupture in up to 10-20\% of patients, therefore, one must
    keep a heightened suspicion for this in the post-operative
    period.(Veith et al. 2009)
  \item
    It is important to note that a patient with a soft abdominal exam
    can still have abdominal compartment syndrome particularly with an
    enlarged body habitus.
  \item
    Laparotomy may initially worsen hypotension and hemodynamic
    instability due to reperfusion injury.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Renal failure can occur due to suprarenal aortic clamping,
  atheromatous embolization or hypotension causing acute tubular
  necrosis (ATN).

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    A suprarenal clamp time of less then 30 minutes is ideal to reduce
    the risk of renal failure.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Postoperative ileus is common. Duodenal obstruction from dissection of
  the ligament of Treitz can mimic a gastric outlet obstruction.
\item
  Ischemic colitis of the left colon and rectum is the most serious
  gastrointestinal complication.(Moghadamyeghaneh et al. 2016)

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Incidence ranges from 0.2 - 10\%, 3-4x more common after operations
    for occlusive disease than aneurysmal disease.
  \item
    It is important to study the collateral pathways on the preoperative
    CT scan and the patient's history to assist in surgical decisions
    regarding IMA reimplantation including:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Stenosis/occlusion of the SMA
    \item
      Previous colectomy
    \item
      IMA or Hypogastric artery occlusion
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Earliest manifestation is postoperative diarrhea, especially bloody
    diarrhea.
  \item
    Sigmoidoscopy is needed for diagnosis.

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Mild colon ischemia with patchy mucosal involvement should be
      treated with bowel rest, fluid resuscitation and antibiotics.
      Transmural necrosis requires emergent operation with colon
      resection. Patients can be left in discontinuity or an end
      colostomy performed depending on stability.
    \item
      The mortality rate with colon ischemia after aneurysm surgery is
      about 25\% but reaches over 50\% if bowel resection is
      required.(Brewster et al. 1991) This is a very heavily tested
      topic for both general surgery and vascular surgery boards.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Distal ischemia from embolization downstream can lodge in larger
  vessels or cause microembolization, colloquially known as ``trash
  foot''.
\item
  Infection is rare but can be associated with graft-enteric fistula
  which is another highly tested topic.(Fatima et al. 2013; Gustavo S.
  Oderich et al. 2011; Smeds et al. 2016)

\subsubsection{Postoperative
Surveillance}\label{postoperative-surveillance}}

\textbf{What is the post-operative surveillance required for open and
endovascular approach, and how do they differ?} (Moore, Lawrence, and
Oderich 2019)

\begin{itemize}
\item
  That is a great question because it highlights why open repair has
  continued to be so important, especially for young, healthy patients.
\item
  Post-operative surveillance is necessary in the immediate
  post-operative period for open repair to evaluate incisions. Follow-up
  is only needed every 5-10 years, unless the patient becomes
  symptomatic.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Perianastomotic degeneration occurs in 0.5-10\% of cases. Can be
    diagnosed with CT scan or ultrasound.(Curl et al. 1992)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  In contrast, EVAR patients require a strict postoperative surveillance
  regimen to allow for detection of endoleaks, aneurysm sac expansion,
  stent fracture, limb kinking and material fatigue.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    CT scans at 1-, 6- and 12-month intervals initially then annually
    are recommended which raises concerns related to cost, cumulative
    radiation exposure, and contrast administration.
  \item
    Some physicians may elect to use ultrasound for surveillance with
    CTA prompted if an endoleak is identified or the sac is enlarged,
    particularly in patients with stable aneurysms.
  \item
    The long-term follow-up is often inconsistent and a study of 19,962
    Medicare beneficiaries undergoing EVAR from 2001 to 2008 showed that
    50\% of patients were lost to annual imaging follow-up at 5 years
    after surgery.(A. Schanzer et al. 2015)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Some patients will elect for open repair to avoid frequent
  surveillance if they are a candidate for both, while other patients
  will select endovascular management to avoid the short-term effects
  like longer hospitalizations, post-operative pain, and longer recovery
  time to baseline functioning in open surgery.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{ruptured-aneurysms}{%
\subsection{Ruptured Aneurysms}\label{ruptured-aneurysms}}

\textbf{Although elective repair is important, can you touch on the
management of a ruptured AAA (RAAA) as our last topic of the session?}
(Moore, Lawrence, and Oderich 2019; Lindsay 2019b)

Ruptured AAAs have declined secondary to improved medical management,
decreased rates of smoking and superior diagnostic imaging and
surveillance.

Traditionally, it has been taught that 50\% of ruptured AAAs die in the
field and of those remaining, 50\% will die in the hospital. With time,
the in-hospital mortality rate has decreased.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In one study out of Finland, of 712 patients with ruptured AAAs from
  2003-2013, 52\% died prior to arrival to the hospital. Of those that
  were offered surgery, 67\% of patients were alive at 30 days
  indicating a mortality rate of 33\%. (M. T. Laine et al. 2016)
\end{itemize}

Diagnostic triad on presentation:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Pain, syncope and known or palpable AAA.
\end{itemize}

When a ruptured AAA is suspected or diagnosed, permissive hypotension is
key in the initial management before surgery.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Allowing systolic arterial pressures of 50-70 mmHg as long as the
  patient is mentating appropriately.
\item
  Limits internal bleeding which further limits loss of platelets and
  clotting factors.
\end{itemize}

Initial management involves many considerations like patient stability,
patient's anatomy and the surgeon's experience with either open or
endovascular repair.

Due to the developments of endovascular techniques, it is ideal to have
a CTA prior to the operating room to determine if the patient is a
candidate for an EVAR.

There are two options for expedient aortic control in an unstable
patient with a ruptured aneurysm.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Open supraceliac aortic clamping

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Achieved by retracting the stomach caudally, entering and dividing a
    portion of the gastrohepatic ligament, reaching under and medial to
    the caudate lobe, dividing the pars flaccida, and identifying the
    spine. The aorta lies to the patient's left of the spine and is
    bluntly dissected anteriorly and laterally for aortic clamp
    placement.
  \item
    Another method of supraceliac exposure and control is to mobilize
    and reflect the left lobe of the liver, sweep the esophagus to the
    patient's left, divide the right crus of the diaphragm and bluntly
    dissect both sides of the aorta then apply the clamp.
  \item
    A nasogastric tube can help identify the esophagus when placing this
    clamp to ensure the esophagus has been swept to the patient's left
    and protected.
  \item
    The clamp should be moved down to the desired position for repair
    (supra or infrarenal depending on anatomy of the aneurysm neck) to
    decrease ischemia time to visceral vessels as soon as possible.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Percutaneous occlusive aortic balloon

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Gain percutaneous access and place an occlusive aortic balloon for
    stabilization in the distal thoracic aorta. This will require a long
    support sheath, usually 12fr in size, to prevent distal migration of
    the occlusive balloon.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

EVAR has been used increasingly to treat ruptured AAAs and offers many
theoretical advantages over open repair.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Less invasive, eliminates risk of damage to periaortic and abdominal
  structures, decreases bleeding from surgical dissection, minimizes
  hypothermia and third space losses, and lessens the requirement for
  deep anesthesia.
\item
  EVAR has been deemed superior to open repair for the treatment of RAAA
  in many studies.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    In a study out of UVA published in JVS in August 2020, they looked
    at ruptures in the VQI database from 2003-2018. This resulted in 724
    pairs of open and endovascular pairs after propensity matching. (L.
    J. Wang et al. 2020)

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      There was a clear advantage of endovascular compared to open
      repair in patient's with suitable anatomy.
    \item
      Length of stay was decreased with 5 vs 10 days in open. 30 day
      mortality was much lower at 18\% vs 32\%. Major adverse events
      like MI, Renal failure, leg ischemia, mesenteric ischemia,
      respiratory complications were much lower in the EVAR group at
      35\% vs 68\% in the open group.
    \item
      All cause 1 year survival was much higher with EVAR at 73\% vs
      59\% in the open group.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Despite improved RAAA results with EVAR, conversion from EVAR to open
  AAA repair appears to have the most unfavorable outcomes in terms of
  mortality.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Conversions can be early or late and are due to access-related
    problems, errors in endograft deployment, graft migration,
    persistent endoleak, graft thrombosis, or infection.
  \item
    In a study evaluating 32,164 patients from NSQIP with 300
    conversions (7,188 standard open repairs and 24,676 EVARs),
    conversion to open repair was associated with a significantly higher
    30-day mortality than standard open repair (10\% vs 4.2\%) and EVAR
    (10\% vs 1.7\%). In addition, conversion patients compared to
    standard open patients were more likely to undergo new dialysis
    (6.0\% vs.~3.5\%), cardiopulmonary resuscitation (5.3\% vs.~1.9\%),
    postoperative blood transfusion (42.3\% vs.~31.6\%), and have a
    myocardial infarction (5.0\% vs.~2.2\%). (Ultee et al. 2016b)
  \item
    A more recent systematic review and meta-analysis found the elective
    late open conversion has comparable outcomes to primary open
    aneurysm repair. 36\% are able to complete with infrarenal clamp
    alone. Highest complication rate in urgent setting (10x higher
    mortality). (Goudeketting et al. 2019)

\chapter{Mesenteric Disease}\label{mesenteric-disease}}

Authors: \emph{Matt Chia, MD and Nick Mouawad, MD}

Mesenteric vascular disease can be broken down into three disease states
that we'll cover today. There's the arterial disease, which is clearly
separated into acute mesenteric ischemia and chronic mesenteric
ischemia. Then there is venous disease, which we'll touch on briefly.
There are also a handful of somewhat related diseases that we'll also
sprinkle into these discussions, like median arcuate ligament syndrome
and SMA syndrome, but that's overall where we're headed.

Mesenteric collatorals are important for protecting against mesenteric
ischemia. The gastroduodenal and pacreaticoduodenal arteries connect the
celiac and SMA. The meandering artery (Arc of Riolan) and marginal
artery of Drummond connect IMA and SMA. Hemorrhoidal branches connect
internal iliacs and IMA. (A. Chandra and Quinones-Baldrich 2010; van
Gulik and Schoots 2005)

\hypertarget{presentation-and-evaluation}{%
\subsection{Presentation and
Evaluation}\label{presentation-and-evaluation}}

\textbf{Can you tell me about the classic presentation and approach to
patients presenting with acute mesenteric ischemia?}

These patients present with the sudden onset of abdominal pain. Nausea,
vomiting, distention, and diarrhea (possibly bloody, described as
``sudden and forceful evacuation'') are the common symptoms. Pain out of
proportion is the classic buzzword, and can be hidden on multiple choice
tests with a pain score of 10/10 with only mild abdominal tenderness on
physical exam.

Etiology most often from acute embolism (40-50\%), which is often
secondary to cardiac source (atrial fibrillation or recent MI).(Wyers,
Mark C and Martin 2019)

Vitals typically normal, possible tachycardia.

Lab evaluation typically unremarkable. Leukocytosis, hemoconcentration,
and acidosis (high anion gap) all are frequently found, but the absence
of these definitely does \textbf{not} rule out acute mesenteric
ischemia.

D-dimer has been proposed as a reasonable rule-out test for acute
mesenteric ischemia.

\textbf{How about radiology studies?}

\ul{Plain film:}

Frequently normal, may show ileus in the early stages. In late stage
acute mesenteric ischemia, findings on plain film can include bowel wall
edema (thumbprinting) or pneumatosis.

\ul{CT angio:}

Probably represents the most common diagnostic modality to diagnose
acute mesenteric ischemia. CTA has the advantages of speed,
availability, and noninvasiveness when compared to conventional
angiography, and also allows for some assessment of the degree of bowel
involvement.~

Preferentially, a ``negative'' oral contrast agent would help prevent
oral contrast from causing artifact or obscuring evaluation of the
vessels, although the availability of these agents may limit their use.

\textbf{How about mesenteric duplex (vascular lab studies)?}

Mesenteric duplex has the advantage of being able to see the velocity of
flow across a stenosis, giving you a good method of quantifying the
significance of a stenosis. However, bowel gas often limits the acoustic
windows for visualizing the mesenteric arteries, and so we usually will
have patients fast for several hours before a study. Also, duplex is
more sensitive for proximal disease rather than distal mesenteric
involvement. For these reasons, mesenteric duplex is considered the gold
standard for evaluating chronic mesenteric ischemia, but has no real
role in the evaluation of acute mesenteric ischemia. Can you imagine,
having a tech mash a transducer into a patient with acute abdominal
pain?\ul{!}~

\hypertarget{management-19}{%
\subsection{Management}\label{management-19}}

\textbf{What's your approach to the initial management of the patient?}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \ul{Resuscitation}. Fluids, fluids, fluids. These patients are really
  volume down, and are headed towards a profound distributive shock that
  will be worsened by your eventual plan for revascularization (think
  ischemia-reperfusion injury). Also look for electrolyte imbalances and
  correct those early.
\item
  \ul{Antibiotics}. These patients are not usually septic on initial
  presentation, but are at high-risk, so broad-spectrum antibiotics with
  gut coverage (Gram negative and anaerobes) are standard of care.
\item
  \ul{Heparin}. In the absence of a clinical contraindication, these
  patients should be systemically heparinized, with a bolus, as soon as
  the diagnosis is made.~
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Which blood vessel does acute mesenteric ischemia typically
involve?}

The SMA. This makes sense if you think of each mesenteric distribution.
The celiac distribution has organs that have redundant blood supply
(like liver and stomach). The IMA is frequently occluded in patients
with AAA, but the patients are rarely ever symptomatic due to collateral
flow. The hypogastrics (which ARE mesenteric vessels, especially in the
situation of an occluded IMA) principally supply the rectum from a
mesenteric standpoint.

For embolic pathology, the acute angle of the SMA seems to predispose it
to capture emboli from above, but this is more theoretical than proven.
The embolism is often lodged distal to middle colic vessel.(Wyers, Mark
C and Martin 2019; Kazmers 1998)

\textbf{Tell me about the two main pathologies, and how they would
differ in terms of the anatomy and operative findings.}

So the two most common etiologies of acute mesenteric ischemia are
embolism and thrombosis.~

Embolism is the more common, where preexisting thrombus (think atrial
fibrillation, mural thrombus from thoracic aneurysm, etc.) or plaques
from atherosclerotic disease break off and lodge in the SMA. The classic
operative finding is that an embolism lodges just distal to the middle
colic artery, where there is a significant caliber change in the SMA.
This is distal to the first few jejunal branches off of the SMA, leading
to the classic sparing of the proximal jejunum and transverse colon. In
other words, the mid to distal jejunum and all of the ileum will be
ischemic, but other areas of the SMA territory are spared.
Atherosclerotic debris is typically smaller, and results in smaller,
more patchy areas of ischemia.

Thrombosis occurs primarily as a plaque rupture of preexisting
atherosclerotic disease, resulting in acute thrombosis at the site of
the disease. Thus the patients will often present with an
acute-on-chronic symptomatology, having classic symptoms of postprandial
abdominal pain, food fear, and weight loss, but with a sudden onset of
severe symptoms. This frequently allows for the development of
mesenteric collaterals, which may make the onset of acute symptoms more
insidious than for embolic pathology. In the majority of situations, the
atherosclerotic disease is most severe right at the origin (consistent
with what we know about shear stress and branch points in blood
vessels). This means that when the plaque ruptures, the entirety of the
SMA occludes, leading to ischemia of the entire territory, as opposed to
the jejunal-sparing distribution seen in embolic disease.

\textbf{Describe the operative steps to getting exposure of the
supraceliac aorta (or the celiac artery).}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Divide triangular ligament to mobilize left lobe of liver
\item
  Divide gastrohepatic ligament to enter the lesser sac~
\item
  Retract liver to right with a self-retaining retractor
\item
  Push esophagus left (use NGT to assist with identification)
\item
  Divide peritoneum overlying crura to identify celiac vessels
\item
  Typically trace common hepatic artery backwards to identify celiac
  artery

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Watch out for the left gastric vein as it crosses the celiac artery
    as it drains the lesser curve of the stomach into the portal vein.
  \item
    About half of the time, the phrenic artery takes an origin from the
    celiac artery and must be controlled during exposure.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  To expose the supraceliac aorta, divide the median arcuate ligament
  and separate the left and right crura from each other.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{So through this kind of exposure, what mesenteric vessels do you
get access to?}

You can trace most of the proximal celiac distribution right at the
origin, and through this exposure you get access to the origin of the
SMA if you mobilize the superior border of the pancreas. The neck of the
pancreas and the splenic vein cross the anterior of the SMA, obscuring
the rest of the mid and distal SMA from the superior approach.

\textbf{How about getting to the rest of the SMA?}

There are a couple of places you can get exposure to the SMA.~

Most commonly you'll hear it described at ``root of the mesentery.''
Specifically, lifting up the transverse colon will stretch out its
mesentery (i.e.~transverse mesocolon). At the bottom, or ``root'' of the
transverse mesocolon, a transverse incision is made. If the middle colic
artery is palpable in the mesocolon, the incision can be made around it,
and you can trace the middle colic backwards to the SMA. Usually you'll
find the SMV first, and the SMA will be just to the left of it. Be sure
to identify and preserve small jejunal branches during the dissection.
If needed, careful dissection superiorly, going behind the inferior
border of the pancreas can get a little more proximal exposure.
Embolectomy through a transverse arteriotomy in the SMA is the best
approach.(Wyers and Martin 2019; Kazmers 1998)

Alternatively, you can get to the SMA from a lateral approach,
specifically from the left side. Begin by dividing the ligament of
Treitz and mobilizing the 4th portion of the duodenum. The SMA is found
in the tissues just cephalad to the duodenum. You can also improve your
proximal exposure if needed by retracting the inferior border of the
pancreas cephalad to the level of the left renal vein.

Other options include a retroperitoneal exposure, like you were
preparing to treat a thoracoabdominal aneurysm. Additionally, the more
distal SMA can just be identified in the small bowel mesentery.

\textbf{So for the operative strategy for acute mesenteric ischemia,
tell me about the general approach to the patient.}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \ul{Resect frankly necrotic bowel and contain gross spillage}. Once
  you revascularize the bowel, compromised-appearing bowel may improve
  and not need immediate resection. Thus the first step is only damage
  control, to remove anything completely unsalvageable that is making
  the patient sick, or anything causing gross contamination of the
  operative field. The key is you're not doing anything definitive with
  the bowel as your first step.
\item
  \ul{Revascularization}. SMA embolectomy is the initial management of
  choice for embolic disease. Thrombotic disease, on the other hand, may
  be more challenging to treat by embolectomy alone, and frequently are
  treated with a bypass. (More to come on these procedures).
\item
  \ul{Re-assess bowel viability}. Clinical status permitting, 20-30
  minutes should be taken to fully assess the results of the
  revascularization before proceeding with resection. Perfusion can be
  assessed by many methods, including clinically, by Doppler, pulse
  oximetry (a.k.a. photoplethysmography), fluorescein fluorescence, etc.
  The take home is to give the bowel enough time to be perfused before
  going ahead with resection.
\item
  \ul{Proceed with temporizing or definitive bowel repair}. Resection,
  leaving in discontinuity, primary anastomosis, diversion, etc. All of
  these are options on the table, but the key here is that all of the
  previous steps occur before addressing the bowel.~
\item
  \ul{Consider second-look laparotomy.}~Many times, bowel may look
  questionable even after revascularization and thorough re-assessment.
  To preserve the most bowel length, it may be reasonable to leave
  borderline bowel alone at the index operation and do a ``second look''
  to fully reassess the bowel, especially after the patient has
  benefited from aggressive resuscitation in the ICU.
\end{enumerate}

Endovascular approaches to acute mesenteric ischemia have been described
but data is limited. Exploratory laparotomy and embolectomy should be
preferred management.(Wyers and Martin 2019)

\textbf{Let's talk a little about the steps for an SMA embolectomy.}

Typically, you'll expose at the root of the transverse mesocolon. After
obtaining proximal and distal control, an arteriotomy is made, and
embolectomy can be performed by passing Fogarty catheters in both a
retrograde and antegrade fashion. The arteriotomy can be made
transversely for an embolectomy, and thus could be closed primarily. A
longitudinal arteriotomy may be advisable if you have a high suspicion
that you'll need to do a bypass, and if not, may be closed with vein
patch angioplasty (remember that the field is contaminated or dirty in
many situations).

\textbf{So if I'm gonna do a bypass, what are my options for conduit?}

Yeah, so again, because the field is frequently contaminated or dirty, a
good conduit is saphenous, followed by femoral vein. Thus every patient
undergoing surgery for acute mesenteric ischemia should have both legs
prepped out in the field. Prosthetic conduit has the advantages of being
more resistant to kinking (externally reinforced), likely better patency
than vein (although data are a little mixed), but in the situation of
gross contamination may be less preferred than vein. Other less common
options include cryo-preserved cadaveric homograft, or rifampin-soaked
prosthetic.

\textbf{And what are some of my options for constructing a bypass?}

\ul{Short retrograde aorto-SMA bypass:}

This bypass takes is origin off of the aorta just below the SMA,
anastomosing typically end-side onto the SMA just below its origin in
order to bypass ostial or very proximal disease. This is a relatively
quick bypass, with only one field of dissection directly from the aorta
below the SMA onto the proximal-mid SMA. The length of the bypass is
very short, limiting concerns with kinking or twisting of the bypass.
However, this may not always be feasible, as SMA disease often coexists
with significant aortic disease. Additionally, the other bypasses
described have better reported patency.(Scali et al. 2019)

\ul{Long retrograde R iliac-SMA bypass (``C-loop''):}

This bypass originates from the right common iliac artery, which
presents a number of distinct advantages over an aorto-mesenteric
bypass. First, using the iliacs avoids the hemodynamic consequences of
an aortic cross-clamp, which may be contraindicated depending on your
patient's medical condition. Second, you can avoid showering, causing
dissection, or otherwise injuring your clamp sites if you have
significant disease in the mesenteric segment of the aorta, which is
common in patients with chronic mesenteric ischemia. The graft should be
tunneled in a gentle C-loop towards the SMA to avoid kinking or
twisting. The proximal anastomosis is performed end-side on the iliac
artery, and the distal can be performed either end-end or end-side
depending on the anatomy of the disease. Especially when using
prosthetic in a contaminated field, you can consider taking an omental
flap to wrap or cover the prosthetic.

\ul{Antegrade supraceliac aorta-SMA bypass:}

This bypass originates from the supraceliac aorta. If revascularization
of both celiac and SMA is planned, a bifurcated graft can be selected. A
side-biting aortic clamp can be used to mitigate the hemodynamic effect
of an aortic cross-clamp. The tunnel to the SMA is created with gentle
finger dissection in a retropancreatic plane, taking care to avoid
injury to the SMV.

\textbf{What other options have been described for treatment of acute
mesenteric ischemia?}

\ul{Retrograde open mesenteric stenting (ROMS)}

So ROMS is a hybrid procedure involving an upper mid-line laparotomy
that is used to evaluate the bowel. Through this incision, SMA exposure
is obtained just as in a traditional open fashion at the root of the
mesentery. The mid-SMA is then punctured under direct vision, and the
area of disease is attempted to be treated from a retrograde approach
back into the aorta. If bowel ischemia is found, the upper mid-line is
easily lengthened into a traditional vertical laparotomy
incision.(Milner, Woo, and Carpenter 2004; Blauw et al. 2014; Gustavo S.
Oderich et al. 2018)

\ul{Endovascular treatment (percutaneous thrombectomy / thrombolysis /
pharmacomechanical thrombectomy)}

Some authors have described completely endovascular approaches to
treatment of acute mesenteric ischemia. However, the major limitation is
the inability to assess the bowel. These patients are frequently those
who are deemed to be lower-risk for frank bowel ischemia or perforation,
but the rates of laparotomy and bowel resection after these treatments
have been described very high rates. Probably not your first answer for
oral boards.(Lim et al. 2019)

\hypertarget{other-etiologies}{%
\subsection{Other Etiologies}\label{other-etiologies}}

\textbf{What are some other, more rare etiologies of acute mesenteric
ischemia?}

Embolism is the most common etiology of acute mesenteric ischemia
(40-50\%), and thrombotic etiology composes another quarter to a third
of these populations. The other two etiologies to consider are
non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia and mesenteric venous thrombosis.

\textbf{Perfect, so how does a non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia (or
NOMI) patient differ from what we've been talking about?}

So NOMI patients typically do not have a focal lesion like you see with
embolism or thrombosis. What happens to these patients is that
classically they're pretty sick patients with some predisposing factors,
most commonly ESRD. On top of that, there was some clear inciting
hemodynamic event causing sustained hypotension, such as recently
getting a session of hemodialysis or undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass.
The presentation is more indolent and less obvious than embolic or
thrombotic acute mesenteric ischemia, and the imaging findings are more
consistent with a diffuse vasospasm and hypovolemia picture.

Treatment is primarily conservative, with the emphasis on resuscitation
and addressing whatever the underlying etiology is. Adjuncts to this
include placement of infusion catheters into the affected vessel with
infusions of vasodilators (most commonly papaverine at 30-60mg/hr) or
prostaglandin (Wyers, Mark C and Martin 2019; Trompeter et al. 2002)
NOMI with portal venous gas, pneumatosis and free air often indicate
need for laparotomy.

\textbf{How about mesenteric venous thrombosis?}

This is the most rare and most difficult to diagnose. They have a very
slow course, frequently with a lot of other workup already done. There's
a wide variety of causes that have been reported, and any of the things
that contribute to Virchow's triad have been reported (thrombophilia
from coagulopathy or malignancy, venous stasis from abdominal
hypertension or obesity, direct injury from trauma, surgery, or
inflammation). The diagnostic test of choice is a CT with portal vein
contrast, which most commonly identifies thrombosis in the superior
mesenteric vein (but can also involve the IMV, portal vein, or splenic
vein). The treatment of choice is therapeutic anticoagulation.(Acosta
and Björck 2019)

\hypertarget{chronic-mesenteric-ischemia}{%
\section{Chronic Mesenteric
Ischemia}\label{chronic-mesenteric-ischemia}}

\hypertarget{presentation-and-evaluation-1}{%
\subsection{Presentation and
Evaluation}\label{presentation-and-evaluation-1}}

\textbf{How does chronic mesenteric ischemia differ in its
presentation?}

Chronic mesenteric ischemia is characterized by post-prandial abdominal
pain, typically 30-60 minutes after eating (think after gastric emptying
time). This pain is usually severe, crampy, and resolves after minutes
to hours of time. The pain leads to food fear and eventual
\ul{unintentional} weight loss. The next step in evaluation in these
patients is a mesenteric duplex to evaluate for elevated velocities.

However, the clinical presentation here is key. Chronic mesenteric
ischemia is pretty unlikely in patients who do not have this
constellation of clinical symptoms, and it's really common for patients
to be referred with imaging findings of elevated mesenteric velocities
on duplex who have none of the clinical findings, and thus do not
benefit from any intervention.

\textbf{What are the duplex criteria for chronic mesenteric ischemia?}

Yeah, so really the two vessels we're concerned with here are the celiac
artery and the SMA. It's pretty rare that stenosis of the IMA results in
clinically significant ischemia, and also pretty rare that isolated
disease of either the celiac or the SMA would be enough to cause
significant symptoms. Typically you see the classic symptomatology of
chronic mesenteric ischemia in patients with occlusive disease in both
the celiac and the SMA.

The key numbers to remember here are peak systolic velocities (that's
PSV) of 200 cm/s for the celiac artery, and 275 cm/s for the SMA. These
correspond to a stenosis of at least 70\%. Remember, the
\textbf{superior} mesenteric artery has \textbf{higher}~velocity
criteria, in case you forget. These classic numbers come from a study
done in 1993, and many other studies have demonstrated other thresholds.
Make sure to check with your friendly neighborhood vascular technician
to see what the thresholds in your local lab are!

In addition to the PSV, you can also use the end diastolic velocity
(EDV) to predict stenosis. For the EDV values in the celiac and the SMA,
think approximately 50 cm/s predicts a stenosis of 50\% (easy to
remember, \textbf{50-50}). This is known as Bowersox criteria, and is
actually \textgreater45, but 50 is easier to remember.(Bowersox et al.
1991)

You can also predict a higher degree of stenosis with EDV values. This
is easy for the SMA, where an EDV of 70 cm/s predicts a stenosis of 70\%
(\textbf{70-70}). For the celiac, it's a bit higher, where an EDV of 100
cm/s predicts that same 70\% stenosis.

So to review the numbers: (Moneta et al. 1991, 1993; Zwolak et al. 1998;
AbuRahma et al. 2012)

\begin{itemize}
\item
  PSVs: 200 in the celiac or 275 in the SMA gives you 70\% stenosis
\item
  EDVs: 50 in the celiac or 50 in the SMA gives you 50\% stenosis
\item
  EDV \#2: 100 in the celiac, or 70 in the SMA gives you 70\% stenosis.
\end{itemize}

Final thought. When the celiac artery is severely narrowed or occluded,
often you'll have retrograde flow coming from the SMA via collaterals
(these are your pancreaticoduodenal arcades via the GDA). You can see
this as backwards flow in the common hepatic artery, and this has 100\%
specificity for disease in the celiac artery.(Warncke et al. 2019)

\hypertarget{management-20}{%
\subsection{Management}\label{management-20}}

\textbf{What's next in the approach to these patients?}

Frequently they're going to get some kind of axial imaging, either CTA
or MRA, to help plan for their revascularization, although this isn't
strictly necessary. Often endovascular approaches are the mainstay of
treatment. Remember that the angle of the SMA frequently favors a
brachial approach, although you can also engage the SMA from a femoral
approach with preformed catheters (think Sos, Cobra, etc) or steerable
sheaths. Remember to watch out for median nerve compression from
brachial sheath hematomas if you've opted for a percutaneous brachial
approach, with a low threshold to evacuate the hematoma and perform
median nerve decompression if the patient develops and symptoms in the
median nerve distribution postoperatively. Also remember that a brachial
sheath hematoma will not be easily palpable or visible at the skin
level, so the neurologic exam postoperatively is key.

Single vessel SMA revascularization is widely accepted for chronic
mesenteric ischemia without necessarily needing to revascularize the
celiac axis. (Gustavo S. Oderich and Ribeiro 2019a; Foley et al. 2000)

\textbf{Any other technical tips for endo intervention on the mesenteric
arteries?}

The best view for diagnostic angiography in mesenteric ischemia is the
lateral view.

Most often balloon-expandable stents are selected for the mesenteric
circulation. The precision of deployment and the increased hoop strength
of a balloon expandable stent make them more favorable here over the
radial force of a self-expanding stent. You can also flare the proximal
end of a balloon-expandable stent into the aorta, making sure that
you've really treated any ostial disease. Some authors advocate for use
of embolic protection devices to prevent distal embolism, and other
authors also advocate for the use of covered stents for the mesenteric
circulation due to better patency.(Gustavo S. Oderich et al. 2013;
Gustavo S. Oderich and Ribeiro 2019a)

\textbf{What is the surveillance protocol for an SMA stent?}

At most institutions it is 1mo, 6mo and annually thereafter.(Mohler et
al. 2012; Zierler et al. 2018)

\textbf{How about open revascularization?}

In most centers, up to 80\% of CMI is treated endovascularly. Open is
often reserved for those that fail endovascular therapy.(Gustavo S.
Oderich, Gloviczki, and Bower 2010; Gustavo S. Oderich and Ribeiro
2019a)

So we talked a lot about open revascularization earlier in the acute
mesenteric ischemia segment. The techniques are broadly similar, with
the exception that often for chronic mesenteric ischemia, frequently
you'll be planning to revascularize both the celiac and the SMA. The
approach for this is with a bifurcated graft from the supraceliac aorta,
taking one limb down to the celiac artery, and the other limb tunneled
in a retropancreatic fashion to the mid-SMA. Remember that this approach
requires a supraceliac aortic cross clamp, which your patient may not be
able to tolerate. But single revascularization of SMA is often
acceptable with appropriate collaterals. Taking a retrograde bypass off
of the common iliac artery as we previously described may be a better
option for patients with significant comorbidities. A further option
that completely avoids a bypass is to go right for a trapdoor
endarterectomy of the celiac artery and the SMA, allowing you to address
coral reef or proximal/ostial disease (such as flush occlusions) that
are difficult to treat endovascularly.~

\hypertarget{visceral-aneurysms}{%
\section{Visceral Aneurysms}\label{visceral-aneurysms}}

Aneurysms can occur in a diverse range of vascular beds in the visceral
vessels. Size criteria for repair is dependent on the location and the
etiology, with some aneurysms mandating repair at any size (gastric,
gastroepiploic, gastroduodenal, pancreaticoduodenal, SMA, colic), and
others considered appropriate to observe in asymptomatic patients until
certain size thresholds are met. The SVS clinical practice guidelines
are the optimal resource to review these criteria.(Chaer et al. 2020)

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{images/mesenteric.jpg}

}

\end{figure}

\hypertarget{sma-aneurysm}{%
\subsection{SMA Aneurysm}\label{sma-aneurysm}}

If symptomatic, most SMA aneurysms are mycotic in nature and require
treatment. Treat with resection and saphenous vein interposition and 6
weeks antibiotic therapy based on intraoperative cultures.(W.-K. Lee et
al. 2008 Nov-Dec)

\hypertarget{splenic-aneurysm}{%
\subsection{Splenic Aneurysm}\label{splenic-aneurysm}}

Repair all pseudoaneurysms, or if size \textgreater{} 3cm, or at any
size if of childbearing age. Consider splenectomy vaccines pre-treatment
(covers encapsulated organisms Shigella, Haemophilus influenzae, and
Neisseria).

Post splenic aneurysm embolization, L flank pain in stable patients
likely represents splenic infarction. Treat with hydration and
analgesia. Rates are lower in stented patients.(Kwong, Rockman, and
Kashyap, n.d.; Piffaretti et al. 2007; C. Zhu et al. 2019)

Splenic artery embolization also an effective way to treat
thrombocytopenia, particularly chemo induced, when splenectomy is too
high risk.(Bhatia et al. 2015)

\hypertarget{median-arcuate-ligament-syndrome-mals}{%
\section{Median Arcuate Ligament Syndrome
(MALS)}\label{median-arcuate-ligament-syndrome-mals}}

\textbf{Can you tell me about median arcuate ligament syndrome and how
that differs from chronic mesenteric ischemia?}

Median arcuate ligament syndrome (MALS), which has many names (Dunbar
syndrome, celiac axis compression syndrome, etc.) is a somewhat
controversial entity that occurs when repeated compression of the celiac
artery occurs against the median arcuate ligament during respiratory
variation. The thing you want to visualize here is that during full
exhalation, the lungs are completely emptied, and the diaphragm moves up
at a sharper angle. This angulation kinks off the celiac artery more
severely, so velocities in \textbf{exhalation} are \textbf{higher} in
MALS. However, these findings are common in asymptomatic patients, and
so just like chronic mesenteric ischemia, the clinical presentation is
key. They'll have a similar presentation as chronic mesenteric ischemia
patients, with post-prandial pain, food fear, and weight loss, but often
the symptomatology is a little more indolent in these patients. Because
of this, these patients have frequently gotten the million dollar workup
for nonspecific GI pain. Duplex ultrasound of shows celiac PSV
\textgreater200 and EDV \textgreater50, normalizes during deep
inspiration, and post-stenotic spectral broadening.(Zwolak et al. 1998)

The treatment of choice for suspected MALS is a laparoscopic median
arcuate ligament release, frequently performed by a MIS/foregut surgeon.
A key point here is that you don't want to be fooled into putting a
stent in these patients before they've gotten their median arcuate
ligament release, because the dynamic motion of the diaphragm is likely
to crimp or bend the stent if that hasn't been treated yet. It may be
that some patients benefit from endovascular treatment after release,
though, as some think that the chronic damage from MALS can result in
intimal damage/scarring that persists even after the extrinsic
compression is treated by the median arcuate ligament release.

\hypertarget{sma-syndrome}{%
\section{SMA Syndrome}\label{sma-syndrome}}

\textbf{What is SMA syndrome?}

SMA syndrome, also called Wilkie's Syndrome is a rare entity where the
3rd portion of the duodenum gets compressed between the SMA and the
aorta, causing a functional gastric outlet obstruction. Patients are
typically emaciated, having lost a significant amount of weight before
their symptom onset. What's happened is they've lost the retroperitoneal
fat pat that normally surrounds the SMA, and so the angle between the
SMA and the aorta becomes more acute, pinching off the duodenum.

Classic findings in fluoroscopic swallow in SMA syndrome are delayed
gastric emptying, a dilated duodenum, to and fro peristalsis in the
proximal duodenum and cutoff in the third portion. EGD can show
pulsation in the 3rd portion of the duodenum.(Warncke et al. 2019)

The treatment of choice here is enteral feeding with a nasojejunal tube
or other surgically placed tube and TPN, because what really will help
them here is weight gain. GJ bypass or duodenal mobilization is
sometimes needed for treatment, but is controversial. It's not really a
mesenteric vascular disease, but it sometimes shows up on exams as a
related entity.(Welsch, Büchler, and Kienle 2007; Merrett et al. 2009)

\hypertarget{uterine-fibroids}{%
\section{Uterine Fibroids}\label{uterine-fibroids}}

Symptomatic uterine fibroids are now often treated with uterine artery
embolization. Many patients require bilateral uterine artery
embolization (UAE), but may only need unilateral if blood supply is
unilateral. Infarcted tissue can be expelled or become infected even
years after initial embolization. (Stępniak 2018)

Disease}\label{renovascular-ischemic-disease}}

\textbf{What is renovascular hypertension?}

Hypertension as a result of progressive renal artery stenosis. While
renal artery stenosis is a relatively common finding in older patients
with hypertension, it's relatively uncommon as the primary cause of
hypertension.

\textbf{What is ischemic nephropathy?}

Decreased renal function and/or chronic kidney disease that results from
atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis due to a reduction in glomerular
filtration rate (GFR) and rise in creatinine produced by any cause of
diminished renal blood flow. Primary mechanism is chronic hypoperfusion.
(Rickey and Geary 2019a)

\textbf{Who is at risk for ischemic nephropathy?}

Renal injury can develop in anyone with a kidney or kidney region beyond
a critically stenotic artery. Any of the following flow limiting lesions
can cause ischemic neuropathy OR renovascular hypertension.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Atherosclerotic disease of the aorta or renal arteries (most common) -
  you'll generally see this in patients over 45 years old, likely with
  known PVD/CAD---though it can occur as an isolated renal
  lesion---usually involving the aortic orifice or the proximal main
  renal artery.
\item
  Fibromuscular dyplasia - These patients are most often women under the
  age of 50 years and typically involves the mid- or distal main renal
  artery or the intrarenal branches.
\item
  Coarctation of the aorta or mid-aortic syndrome
\item
  Large vessel arteritis (rare) - although a rare cause of renovascular
  hypertension, this is the most common presentation of Takayasu's
  arteritis (60\%). First line therapy is open revascularization.
  (Ehlert and Abularrage 2019b; F. A. Weaver et al. 2004; F. P. Zhu et
  al. 2012)
\item
  Iatrogenic causes - Rarely iatrogenic from malposition or migration of
  endovascular aortic stent grafts over the renal orifices.
\end{itemize}

The prevalence of renovascular hypertension in patients with mild
hypertension is probably less than 1\%. \textbf{\emph{However in
patients with acute progression, severe or refractory hypertension the
prevalence may be as high as 10 to 40\%.}} However, disease may not
entirely be attributable to a flow limiting lesion. There may be a
component of cholesterol embolization or small vessel atherosclerotic
disease that may contribute to progression of renovascular disease.

The effect of the stenosis may not be clinically apparent due to
compensatory function of the unaffected contralateral kidney. We know
5-22 \% of patients 50 years or older who have advanced CKD have some
degree of renal artery stenosis and 23-54\% of those patients with
stenosis have bilateral renal artery disease.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Most cases of renal artery stenosis affect one side much more than the
  other; one kidney is affected with the second kidney being essentially
  normal, hence the designation ``unilateral'' disease.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    In patients with unilateral renal artery stenosis, contralateral
    kidney is damaged by uncontrolled hypertension and circulating
    angiotensin II and aldosterone. (Rickey and Geary 2019a)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Patients who are diagnosed with ischemic nephropathy usually have
  high-grade stenosis of both renal arteries or stenosis to a solitary
  functioning kidney.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    It is this subpopulation of the disease that merits specific
    consideration because of its additional contribution to fluid
    retention, loss of kidney function, and congestive heart failure.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Bilateral renal arterial stenosis is associated with more widespread
  atherosclerotic disease, higher serum creatinine levels, and higher
  mortality than unilateral disease
\end{itemize}

However, flow limiting lesions may be an ``incidental'' finding in
patients who have CKD or hypertension that is caused by a separate
disorder (i.e.~diabetic nephropathy and essential/primary hypertension).
Because of this, it can be very difficult to distinguish between patient
whose disease is induced by renal artery stenosis and those who have
alternative causes of CKD or renovascular hypertension.

Renal (especially bilateral) hypoperfusion induces activation of the
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system which increases vascular tone and
impairs sodium excretion resulting in expansion of the extracellular
fluid volume.

\textbf{The clinical findings that suggest that ischemic renovascular
disease is an underlying cause of hypertension, include:}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Recent or rapid development of severe hypertension.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Relatively specific for renovascular hypertension and is the
    strongest predictor of anti-hypertensive benefit from
    revascularization.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Severe hypertension that may be treatment resistant.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Some patients with ischemic nephropathy are normotensive, which may
    be due in part to a reduced cardiac output
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Recent reduction in kidney function (over last 6-12 months) with or
  without the administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)
  inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs).

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Rise in serum creatinine is more common with agents that block the
    renin-angiotensin system than with other antihypertensive drugs
    because glomerular filtration rate (GFR) often depends upon the
    efferent arteriolar actions of angiotensin II in this setting. RAS
    can worsen ACE-I and ARB induced renal dysfunction due to systemic
    hypotension, efferent arterial vasodilation, and reduced glomerular
    hydrostatic pressure, in turn lowering GFR. (Rickey and Geary 2019a;
    Schoolwerth et al. 2001)
  \item
    More common with bilateral as compared with unilateral disease
    because there is hemodynamic compromise to the entire renal
    functional mass
  \item
    This usually resolves after withdrawal of the drug.
  \item
    Restoring the renal blood supply in such cases can recover the
    ability to use these drugs for blood pressure control.
  \item
    Significant variability of serum creatinine concentration that may
    be due to changes in volume status
  \end{itemize}
\item
  A rapid rise in arterial pressure associated with sudden development
  of left ventricular failure (``flash pulmonary edema'').

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    This finding is more common with renal artery stenosis because
    bilateral disease is also associated with diuretic resistance and
    sympathetic adrenergic activation
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Deterioration of kidney function after placement of an endovascular
  aortic stent graft -- IATROGENIC

  \tightlist
  \item

    bypass, ligate splenic artery distally and then perform end-to-end

\hypertarget{evaluation-11}{%
\subsection{Evaluation}\label{evaluation-11}}

\textbf{So how can we determine who has CKD or hypertension due to
renovascular stenosis that we can actually help?}

This is probably the most important question since in this whole disease
process.

To start, if a patient has the clinical manifestations of ischemic
nephropathy or renovascular hypertension as we discussed above, a
presumptive diagnosis of ischemic nephropathy can be made if there is
radiologic documentation of significant stenosis (usually more than 70
\% luminal occlusion) of both renal arteries or of one renal artery to a
solitary functioning kidney.

\textbf{But how do we know the vascular occlusive disease posing
critical hemodynamic limitation to kidney function?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Doppler ultrasound criteria (Hoffmann et al. 1991; Zierler and Dawson
  2016)

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    PSV \textgreater200 cm/sec or renal aortic ratio \textgreater3.5 and
    post stenotic turbulence, suggests \textgreater60\% stenosis, but
    some labs have proposed higher velocities (250-285 cm/s).(Schäberle
    et al. 2016; Rickey and Geary 2019b)
  \item
    Elevated velocities can be seen with tortuosity, but this should be
    able to be confirmed with B-mode. For more see
    Section~\ref{sec-lab-renal}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Generally, luminal occlusion of at least 60 to 75 \% is required to
  limit blood flow and reduce perfusion pressure. CTA or angiogram with
  CO2 are helpful to delineate the anatomy. MRA can be used for
  evaluation:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Pro - no radiation, good imaging of distal renal arteries, no
    degradation from ostial calcium.
  \item
    Cons - requires GAD -\textgreater{} interstitial fibrosis in CKD
    (Galan, Cowper, and Bucala 2006) and degrades with motion and
    respiration (Nelson et al. 1999)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  This degree of stenosis is usually associated with a measurable
  translesional ``pull-back'' pressure gradient of 10 to 15 mmHg, which
  can be measured during conventional angiography.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Can we tell who has cortical hypoxia through diagnostic tests?}

To some degree. Cortical perfusion can be measured by blood oxygen level
dependent magnetic resonance (BOLD-MR). Additionally, inflammatory
markers sampled from renal veins of stenotic kidneys correlated strongly
with the degree of hypoxia (as measured by BOLD-MR), particularly after
correction of the stenosis with angioplasty. Blood Oxygen Level
Dependent Magnetic Resonance (BOLD-MR) can identify levels of cortical
hypoxia which may be associated PSV \textgreater{} 385 cm/sec or reduced
GFR (20 to 25 ml/min).

\textbf{So we have a patient with evidence of malperfused kidneys,
either through worsening renal function or uncontrolled hypertension,
with known discrete stenoses, and we even got a BOLD-MRI which confirms
it. Let's just revascularize them and be done with it?}

Although vascular stenosis or occlusion can initiate these processes,
long-standing ischemia causes parenchymal injury characterized by
inflammation and fibrosis which eventually becomes an irreversible
process. At some point, restoring renal blood flow provides no recovery
of kidney function or clinical benefit. We can at least have some idea
by considering the renal resistive index, the six-month trajectory of
kidney function, and the size of the kidneys or by performing a kidney
biopsy (which is not usually done).

\begin{itemize}
\item
  None of these factors predict the outcome of revascularization with
  certainty.
\item
  \textbf{\emph{Improved and validated methods to evaluate the
  salvageability of kidney function in this disorder are greatly needed
  and are the holy grail of this disease process.}}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Here are some additional criteria that can be useful adjucts to
duplex velocities and cross sectional imaging.}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Renal Resistive index -} Some studies indicate that elevated
  resistive indices in segmental vessels (above 0.80) measured by duplex
  ultrasound denote poor prognosis for renal recovery while a low
  resistive index is a favorable sign. Initially, many were hopeful that
  this would be a very useful indicator, but not many have been able to
  reproduce the initial studies describing this association.(Radermacher
  et al. 2001)
\item
  \textbf{Kidney size -} Very small kidneys (less than 8 cm in longest
  diameter) are usually considered unlikely to recover after
  revascularization.
\item
  \textbf{Kidney biopsy} (not usually performed) - Previous studies
  suggest that biopsy demonstrating preexisting atheroembolic changes
  and interstitial fibrosis indicate a limited potential for recovery.
\item
  \textbf{Comparison of kidney morphology with kidney function -} Some
  investigators have recommended assessing morphological parameters,
  such as renal parenchymal volume and cortical thickness with MRI, and
  comparing these parameters with kidney function measured by
  radionuclide scanning. A kidney with normal morphology in the setting
  of renal artery stenosis and reduced function may indicate a
  ``hibernating kidney'' which may respond to revascularization.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{So how do we get a definitive diagnosis?}

A definitive diagnosis is not usually made before revascularization. In
practice, confirmation of the diagnosis is based upon stabilization or
improvement of the GFR after successful revascularization.

\hypertarget{medical-management-2}{%
\subsubsection{Medical Management}\label{medical-management-2}}

\textbf{Now we think our patient's renal artery stenosis maybe is
causing hypertension or decline in renal function and we can possibly
reverse it\ldots{} can patients with renovascular hypertension just be
treated with anti-hypertensives, such as ACE inhibitors?}

Many of these patients can be treated with medical therapy alone without
loss of function or irreversible fibrosis, sometimes for many years.

Some in-human studies demonstrate that even with moderate reduction in
renal perfusion pressure (40\%) and in renal blood flow (30\%), GFR may
be reduced but renal cortex and medulla tissue oxygenation may be able
to adapt and avoid developing severe hypoxia. However, there are limits
to this adaptation.

As the hypertension is treated, we're lowering the pressure gradient
across the stenosis and can actually increase the degree of renal
malperfusion and worsen the renal function. Oftentimes this loss of
kidney function is a reversible consequence of antihypertensive therapy
but it limits our ability to control the hypertension medically without
causing further damage to the kidney.

Further reduction in renal function can also reflect progressive
narrowing of the renal arteries and/or progressive intrinsic kidney
disease as more advanced vascular occlusion, corresponding to a 70 to
80\% narrowing of the renal artery, leads to demonstrable cortical
hypoxia.

In addition, all of these patients should receive secondary prevention
of cardiovascular morbidity with aspirin, statins, smoking cessation,
and, in patients with diabetes, glycemic control. We're addressing or
prevention progression of stenosis in those with atherosclerotic
disease.

For more on the medical management of vascular disease, see
Section~\ref{sec-pad-medical-management}

\textbf{Who should we fix operatively?}

Some but not all patients should undergo revascularization, patient
selection single most important factor depends upon the hemodynamic
severity and likely recoverability of kidney function.
\textbf{\emph{Again, the factors most closely associated with
recoverability include:}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  A recent onset of hypertension prior to the diagnosis of renal artery
  stenosis (strongest predictor of response to treatment)
\item
  Failure of optimal medical therapy to control the blood pressure or
  intolerance to optimal medical therapy (i.e.~deterioration of renal
  function during antihypertensive drug therapy, such as ACE)
\item
  Recurrent flash pulmonary edema and/or refractory heart failure
\item
  Otherwise unexplained progressive renal insufficiency, particularly if
  proteinuria is absent

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    CKD stage 3a and 3b most likely to benefit from revascularization.
    (Singer et al. 2009) Lower GFR likely to progress to ESRD.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Degree of stenosis, age, pre-procedure BP control and meds are not
  associated with improvement. (Textor, Misra, and Oderich 2013)
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{endovascular}{%
\subsubsection{Endovascular}\label{endovascular}}

Before undergoing diagnostic angiography or potential intervention, the
patient's ACE inhibitor and metformin should be stopped. Continuing or
even initiating anti-platelet therapy and statins are important to
prevent atheroembolization during wire manipulation of the renal
arteries and stent placement.(Hiramoto et al. 2005)

\textbf{But do we have any good data proving our interventions help?}

Early on, observational studies demonstrated a high rate of procedural
success with percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA) and
stent placement (\textasciitilde85\%) in patients with ostial
atherosclerotic disease, as well as a high rate of clinical success
measured by improvements in blood pressure and kidney function in 50 to
75 \% of subjects.

Unfortunately, randomized trials showed no additional benefit from
stenting when added to medical therapy with respect to blood pressure
control, renal function, cardiovascular events, and mortality. But these
studies have their own limitations.

\textbf{The one we keep hearing about is the CORAL trial.}(Cooper et al.
2014) \textbf{Tell me about that.}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Cardiovascular Outcomes in Renal Atherosclerotic Lesions (CORAL) trial
\item
  947 patients (80 \% had unilateral disease) who met the following two
  criteria:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Unilateral or bilateral atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis
    \textgreater60 \% if diagnosed with conventional angiography, peak
    systolic velocity \textgreater300 cm/second if diagnosed by duplex
    Doppler ultrasonography, Luminal narrowing \textgreater80 \% if
    diagnosed with magnetic resonance angiography or computerized
    tomography angiography (or \textgreater70 \% with additional
    evidence of renal ischemia)
  \item
    Systolic hypertension despite two or more antihypertensive
    medications and/or an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)
    \textless60 ml/min/1.73 m2 that was presumably due to the stenosis.
  \item
    All patients received antiplatelet therapy plus best medical therapy
    including ARB
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Revascularization had no additional effect on the primary outcome (a
  composite of cardiovascular or renal death, stroke, myocardial
  infarction, hospitalization for heart failure, a reduction in eGFR by
  more than 30 \%, or end-stage renal disease) as compared with medical
  therapy alone (35.1 versus 35.8 \%).
\item
  No effect on any of the individual components of the primary outcome.
\item
  Low procedural complication rate \textasciitilde2\%
\item
  Similar findings in the ASTRAL trial (A. Investigators 2009)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Well, that sounds pretty convincing, however there are
limitations on existing treatment data:}

\ul{Considerable selection bias} -- For the most part, the patients
enrolled in these trials did \textbf{not} meet the criteria for
selecting patients likely to benefit from intervention (i.e.~short
duration of blood pressure elevation, hypertension resistant to medical
therapy, recurrent flash pulmonary edema):

\begin{itemize}
\item
  CORAL (Cooper et al. 2014)

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Patients hospitalized for heart failure within 30 days of screening
    for the trial were excluded, thereby limiting the number of trial
    participants with recurrent flash pulmonary edema.
  \item
    Mean number of antihypertensive medications used by CORAL
    participants at baseline was 2.1- many had not failed optimal
    medical therapy
  \item
    More than 25 \% had controlled blood pressure upon entry into the
    trial.
  \item
    Mortality and event rates lower than in most previous registries,
    suggesting that many high-risk patients were not enrolled.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  ASTRAL (A. Investigators 2009)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Large number of patients had stenoses that were probably not
    clinically significant (50 to 70 \%), and patients were excluded if
    their primary doctors felt that they ``definitely'' needed
    revascularization.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Results of the trials differ substantially from observational
reports of ``high-risk'' subsets}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  For the most part, patients selected by their treating clinicians to
  undergo revascularization have derived greater benefit from
  revascularization than did patients enrolled in the trials who were
  randomly assigned to revascularization
\end{itemize}

\textbf{We've determined our patient is an appropriate candidate for
intervention, and we don't fully buy into CORAL, what can we do?}

Percutaneous renal angioplasty/stenting in addition to medical therapy
are most commonly employed if technically feasible. Most amenable
lesions to angioplasty are those producing incomplete occlusion in the
main renal artery.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Total occlusions and ostial lesions extending into aorta generally do
  not respond well to angioplasty alone due to elastic recoil.
\end{itemize}

In general, the effects of revascularization on blood pressure were
greater in bilateral disease, but effects on renal function and
mortality did not differ in those with bilateral as compared with
unilateral stenosis .

Most atherosclerotic lesions are now treated with primary stenting to
avoid rapid development of restenosis.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Quick results: maximum antihypertensive response is generally observed
  at 48 hours after the procedure, but BP levels and antihypertensive
  drug requirements often change over subsequent weeks
\item
  A higher initial primary success rate, defined as less than 50 \%
  stenosis (88 versus 57 \%).
\item
  At six months, a higher patency rate (75 versus 29 \%) and a lower
  restenosis rate (14 versus 48 \%).
\item
  Twelve patients assigned to PTRA alone underwent stenting because of
  treatment failure within six months. These patients had a similar
  blood pressure response as those initially treated with stenting.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Performing a renal angiogram and intervention} (Edwards and
Cooper 2019)

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Supine with arms overhead or straight out to the sides
\item
  LAO 15-20deg
\item
  Femoral access
\item
  Flush catheter placed just above the renals. Often start with CO2 and
  selective contrast runs.
\item
  Breath hold, high frame rate and non-DSA due unavoidable patient
  movement
\item
  Often utilize an 0.014 to cross the lesion, and advance a guide
  catheter to secure access.
\item
  Many advocate for primary stenting in atherosclerotic disease with
  uncovered stents to minimize manipulation. Some believe that covered
  stents carry benefit, but they are more expensive, and the evidence
  does not directly support this added cost.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    2005 ACC/AHA guidelines on peripheral artery disease recommends that
    a stent be placed in patients undergoing percutaneous transrenal
    angioplasty (PTRA) for treatment of atherosclerotic renal artery
    stenosis (Hirsch et al. 2006)
  \item
    PTRA without stent placement is rarely performed unless the anatomy
    precludes stenting.
  \item
    POBA without stenting is generally less successful and associated
    with more complications (i.e.~atheroemboli)
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{outcomes}{%
\paragraph{Outcomes}\label{outcomes}}

\textbf{Unilateral disease}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  PTRA alone results in normalization of blood pressure (removal of
  antihypertensive drug therapy) \textasciitilde8-20\%. Some improvement
  50-60\%.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Failure rate \textasciitilde20-30\%
  \item
    Restenosis rate of 8 to 30 \% at two years (without stent)
  \item
    Better results with unilateral fibromuscular disease.
  \item
    Less consistent for patients with chronic hypertension compared with
    patients who have an acute elevation in blood pressure
  \end{itemize}
\item
  In-stent restenosis rates are closer to \textasciitilde11-17\%, with
  11-39\% during the first one to two years

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Detected as a rise in blood pressure requiring more intensive
    therapy
  \item
    Angioplasty/stenting injures the vascular endothelium, which may
    result in restenosis.
  \item
    Symptomatic stenosis leading to a rise in blood pressure or a fall
    in GFR are less common and are reported in 10 to 20 \% of patients
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Bilateral disease}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  25-30\% will recover kidney function to a meaningful degree, sometimes
  avoiding progression to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and/or the
  need for renal replacement therapy.
\item
  \textasciitilde50\% will have little immediate change in kidney
  function but will ``stabilize''
\item
  \textasciitilde20\% will have a progressive deterioration of kidney
  function, sometimes related to the procedure
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{complications-4}{%
\paragraph{Complications}\label{complications-4}}

Complication rate with percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty with
or without stenting is between 5 and 15 \%

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Mostly minor: puncture site hematoma and renal artery dissection.
\item
  Serious complications more rare: renal artery thrombosis or
  perforation, AKI 2/2 atheroembolic disease (\textasciitilde1\%)or
  radiocontrast agent injury.
\item
  Mortality exceedingly rare
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{surveillance-1}{%
\paragraph{Surveillance}\label{surveillance-1}}

Follow-up of patients who have had a renal artery stent should include
serial measurements of blood pressure and estimation of GFR.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Post-stent duplex ultrasound at 2-4weeks with
\item
  Repeated examinations on a quarterly basis (not much data)
\item
  Patients who develop an increase in pressure or reduced GFR after
  stenting should undergo duplex ultrasonography to identify restenosis
\item
  Re-treatment with angioplasty with or without repeat stenting can be
  attempted, but the restenosis rate after repeat angioplasty is
  increased.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Surgical reconstruction may be pursued in patients with recurrent
    episodes of restenosis and loss of kidney function.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{open-surgery}{%
\subsubsection{Open Surgery}\label{open-surgery}}

\textbf{What about an open operation?}

Surgical revascularization used in addition to medical therapy is less
common since the widespread application of effective antihypertensive
drug therapy and endovascular stents in the mid 1990s.

\textbf{So who still gets open repair?} (Benjamin and Hansen 2019)

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Younger patients
\item
  Unfavorable anatomy (i.e.~occlusion or branch disease)
\item
  Failures of endovascular therapy (i.e.~in stent restenosis)
\item
  Need for concomittent aortic revascularization.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{How do we do it?}

Involves bypassing the stenotic segment or of removing a small atrophic
kidney with nearly complete arterial occlusion.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  From the aorta or hepatorenal or splenorenal bypass to avoid diseased
  aorta.
\item
  Bilateral: either bilateral repair or unilateral repair with
  contralateral nephrectomy of a nonfunctional, atrophic kidney.
\end{itemize}

Bilateral ostial disease in a young patient can be treated with
transverse arteriotomy and bilateral renal endarterectomy. Close
primarily or with PTFE/polyester patch. Second line is bilateral bypass
with GVS. (Benjamin and Hansen 2019)

\textbf{How do outcomes compare to PTA/stenting?}

Equally or more effective than PTRA in the treatment of atherosclerotic
disease, with cure of or improvement in the hypertension occurring in 80
to 95 \% of patients. Cure of hypertension after surgery is most likely
in patients who have been hypertensive for less than five years

Lack of complete response was usually associated with one of two
factors:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Presence of underlying primary/essential hypertension
\item
  Development of intrarenal vascular disease due to exposure of the
  contralateral kidney to the elevated blood pressure.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Guidelines recommendations}

2005 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA)
guidelines (Hirsch et al. 2006) Open surgery is reserved primarily for
patients with:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Multiple small renal arteries
\item
  Early primary branching of the main renal artery
\item
  Require aortic reconstruction near the renal arteries for other
  indications (i.e.~aneurysm repair or severe aortoiliac occlusive
  disease)
\item
  In order to avoid manipulation of a highly diseased aorta or failed
  endovascular stents, using extra-anatomic bypass (i.e.~splenorenal,
  ileorenal, or hepatorenal bypass).
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{complications-5}{%
\paragraph{Complications}\label{complications-5}}

In-hospital mortality: \textasciitilde3-10 \% in high volume centers

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Risk factors diffuse atherosclerosis, advanced age, chronic kidney
  disease, heart failure, or chronic lung disease.
\item
  No deaths in 105 procedures for fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD).
\end{itemize}

\section{Fibromuscular Dysplasia
(FMD)}\label{sec-fibromuscular-dysplasia}}

\hypertarget{demographics-13}{%
\subsection{Demographics}\label{demographics-13}}

\textbf{You mentioned FMD as a cause of renovascular hypertension, tell
me more about that\ldots{}}

Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is a non-atherosclerotic, non-inflammatory
disorder that results in progressive arterial stenosis, occlusion,
aneurysm, dissection, or tortuosity.(Jeffrey W. Olin and Sealove 2011)

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Virtually always diagnosed radiographically -- formerly
  pathologically, but rarely sent for specimen in modern diagnosis or
  treatment
\end{itemize}

\textbf{How do we classify it?}

Most commonly classified by angiographic appearance:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Multifocal FMD (more common)

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Angiographic appearance of a ``string of beads.''
  \item
    Corresponds pathologically to medial fibroplasia, the most common
    histologic type, and to perimedial fibroplasia, which is less
    common.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Focal FMD (less common)

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Angiographic appearance of a ``circumferential or tubular stenosis''
  \item
    Corresponds pathologically to intimal fibroplasia but medial
    hyperplasia and peri-arterial hyperplasia may also have a focal
    appearance.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  These two different angiographic subtypes of FMD (multifocal and
  focal) have different phenotypic presentations and natural history. If
  FMD is, in fact, a single disease?
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Where does it occur?}

FMD has been observed in nearly every arterial bed. Two thirds of
patients have multiple arteries involved.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Involvement of the renal arteries \textasciitilde75-80\%
\item
  Involvement of the extracranial cerebrovascular arteries (i.e.~carotid
  and vertebral arteries) \textasciitilde75\%
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Who has FMD?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textasciitilde90\% of cases in adults are in women.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    No female predominance among children with FMD.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Mean age at diagnosis was 52 years, with a range of 5 to 86 years

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    In the past, it was believed that FMD was a disease of young women.
    However, older now know to make up a large proportion of affected
  \end{itemize}
\item
  35-50\% of cases in children and 5-10\% of cases in adults under the
  age of 60 years with renovascular hypertension
\item
  Often an incidental finding:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    4.4\% of potential kidney donors had evidence of FMD.
  \item
    CORAL trial:

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      FMD was discovered in 5.7\% of the total study population (8.8\%
      of enrolled females)
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{etiology-5}{%
\subsubsection{Etiology}\label{etiology-5}}

\textbf{What causes FMD?}

The exact etiology of FMD remains unknown, but some mechanisms have been
proposed

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Most often results from medial fibroplasia (60-90\% of cases).
  Collagen deposits in the media result in elastic fibrils and
  fibromuscular ridges. (Jeffrey W. Olin et al. 2014)
\item
  'Genetics may play an important role in development

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Some studies report autosomal mode of inheritance with variable
    penetrance
  \item
    Potential association with a single nucleotide variant in the
    phosphatase and actin regulator 1 gene (PHACTR1)
  \item
    Variant rs9349379 is also a risk locus for coronary artery disease,
    migraine headache, and cervical artery dissection.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Predominance of young/childbearing age women hormonal influences are
  thought to play a role

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Remains unproven.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Mechanical factors such as stretch and trauma unproven.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{presentation-7}{%
\subsubsection{Presentation}\label{presentation-7}}

\textbf{Does FMD present differently that the atherosclerotic
renovascular disease we talked about?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Varies widely depending on artery affected and as it results from:
\item
  Ischemia related to stenosis
\item
  Dissection and occlusion of major arteries (renal infarction, stroke,
  myocardial infarction)
\item
  Rupture of aneurysms
\item
  Embolization of intravascular thrombi from dissection or aneurysms
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What are the common presenting symptoms and signs}

Manifestations of renal FMD (i.e.~hypertension, flank pain) are more
likely to occur in men, as are arterial dissections and aneurysms.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Most common presenting signs:
\item
  Hypertension -- 67\% (66\% of women and 74 \% of men)
\end{itemize}

But overall hypertension is the most common manifestation of renal
artery FMD in both genders

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Flank pain and abdominal pain can result from ischemia, aneurysm
  rupture, or dissection of renal and mesenteric arteries, respectively.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Are these dissections common?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  High prevalence of aneurysm and/or dissection

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Aneurysm (22\%) and dissection (26\%).

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      34\% of aneurysms were renal
    \item
      11\% of dissections were renal
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    42\% had an aneurysm and/or dissection.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{So should we screen for these dissections in a patient with
known FMD?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Every patient diagnosed with FMD should have one-time, head-to-pelvic
  CTA (or MRA) is an alternative.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    CTA of the neck and head on one day followed one week later by CTA
    of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{When should we suspect FMD?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Hypertension (particularly in a woman under the age of 60 years) with
  findings that would prompt an evaluation for secondary hypertension:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Severe or resistant hypertension.
  \item
    Onset of hypertension before the age of 35 years.
  \item
    A sudden rise in blood pressure over a previously stable baseline.
  \item
    A significant increase in the serum creatinine concentration after
    the institution of therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme
    (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) in the absence
    of an excessive reduction in blood pressure.
  \item
    An epigastric/abdominal bruit.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Renal artery dissection (or carotid, vertebral, coronary)
\item
  Aneurysm in a visceral, carotid, vertebral, or intracranial vessel.
\item
  Renal infarction.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{evaluation-12}{%
\subsection{Evaluation}\label{evaluation-12}}

\textbf{How do we diagnose this and/or distinguish it from renovascular
atherosclerotic disease?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Confirmed by diagnostic imaging that reveals consistent findings
\item
  Noninvasive imaging test is usually performed first. This includes
  CTA, MRA, and Duplex ultrasound.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Let talk about CTA\ldots{}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  CTA is preferable due to higher spatial resolution than MRA, less
  dependence upon technical expertise, and a shorter scan time
\item
  Excellent diagnostic accuracy for FMD of the main renal arteries,
  although the sensitivity decreases when FMD is only present in the
  smaller branch renal arteries.
\item
  Multi-row detector CT scanners may provide additional advantages in
  diagnosis and surveillance because they offer more rapid image
  acquisition, variable section thickness, three-dimensional rendering,
  diminished helical artifacts, and smaller contrast requirements.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What about MRA?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Inconsistent detection of FMD and is performed if CTA is
  contraindicated
\item
  The spatial resolution in the branch vessels is not adequate, and
  artifact may occur, suggesting ``beading'' when none is present.
\item
  May miss mild FMD.
\item
  Can be useful for detecting aneurysms and dissections - can be
  difficult to diagnose on duplex ultrasonography.(Renaud et al. 2012)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{And finally, Duplex ultrasonography}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Detects elevated blood flow velocities in the mid and distal portions
  of the renal artery, most common locations for FMD.
\item
  Increased peak systolic velocity, turbulent blood flow, and tortuosity
  of the mid and distal artery.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \% diameter stenosis reports less helpful and usually inaccurate
  \end{itemize}
\item
  lowest spatial resolution of all of the cross-sectional imaging
  modalities
\item
  most operator dependence
\item
  first choice only in high-volume centers with extensive expertise in
  this technique
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What about non invasive testing?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  DSA is performed in patients if there is a high clinical suspicion of
  FMD, and treatment with revascularization is planned if a stenosis is
  found.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Can improve visualization of the arteries by eliminating background
    soft tissue and bone and has higher spatial resolution than any of
    the other imaging modalities
  \item
    Can measure the pressure gradient across the stenosis

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Pressure decrease threshold of 10 \% or more of the mean pressure
      should be used to decide whether a lesion is hemodynamically
      significant
    \item
      IVUS and optical coherence tomography (OCT) can help identify
      dissection or intramural hematoma or determine response to
      angioplasty.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Negative DSA excludes a diagnosis of FMD in the vascular bed that
    was imaged.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Any place for pathological diagnosis in modern therapy?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Histopathology (and histologic classification) is \textbf{no longer}
  part of the diagnosis.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Only in the rare patient who requires surgical revascularization or
    resection of an aneurysm.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Medical Management}\label{medical-management-3}}

\textbf{So how do we treat this, what warrants intervention and are
those interventions different than what we offer atherosclerotic disease
of the renal arteries?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  All patients with FMD should be placed on antiplatelet therapy (ASA)
  unless otherwise contraindicated
\item
  Antihypertensive therapy

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Most patients will require antihypertensive therapy, even if they
    undergo revascularization.
  \item
    Majority of patients with \textbf{focal} FMD have their blood
    pressure cured with angioplasty
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{endovascular-1}{%
\subsubsection{Endovascular}\label{endovascular-1}}

\textbf{But what about revascularization?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Revascularization Goal: control of hypertension

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    BP can be controlled in most adults with multifocal FMD with a mean
    of two antihypertensive medications
  \item
    Weigh risks and benefits in well controlled hypertension.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{No} randomized trials comparing revascularization with medical
  therapy
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Well then who do we treat?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Recent-onset hypertension, with goal to cure hypertension.
\item
  Resistant hypertension despite compliance with an appropriate
  three-drug regimen.
\item
  Patients unable to tolerate antihypertensive medications or who are
  non-compliant with their medication regimen.
\item
  Adults with bilateral renal FMD, or unilateral renal FMD to a single
  functioning kidney, and unexplained progressive renal insufficiency
  thought to result from renal artery stenosis
\item
  Hypertensive children.
\item
  may be at higher risk than adults for progressive renal parenchymal
  loss, and therefore could benefit from revascularization even if their
  hypertension can be well-controlled with one or two antihypertensive
  medications.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{And what kind of results do we get with revascularization?}

Hypertension is cured or improved following revascularization in a large
proportion of patients with FMD.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Much better than 2/2 atherosclerosis
\item
  Varies considerably from study to study, although hypertension control
  improves in most patients and depends in large part upon the
  definition of cure.
\item
  Not good data on stabilization of either GFR or renal size in patients
  with FMD.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What options do we have in terms of revascularization and do} we
have good results treating FMD with endovascular or open interventions?

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Patients most often treated with angioplasty alone with good success.
  (Davies et al. 2008; T. L. Jenkins et al. 2015)
\item
  Improvement in blood pressure (including those with and without cure)
  was similar with PTA as compared with surgery (86 versus 88 \%).
\item
  Older age and longer duration of hypertension prior to
  revascularization were significantly associated with a lower cure
  rate.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{How do these compare?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  PTA achieves similar technical success and is associated with a lower
  risk of adverse events in observational studies
\item
  Most patients with FMD who are selected for renal revascularization
  have PTA rather than surgery
\item
  Major adverse events were more frequent with surgery (15 versus 6 \%).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{So why choose open surgery?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Cure rates were higher with surgery (54 versus 36 \%).
\item
  Surgery rather than PTA if PTA fails or if the arterial anatomy is not
  amenable to PTA

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Patients with small renal arteries (\textless4 mm), with branch
    renal artery disease, or with extensive intimal fibroplasia.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{So how do we perform Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty} for
FMD?

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Angioplasty is often performed through a transfemoral approach, but
  concomitant stenting is rare, unlike PTA for atherosclerotic RAS
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Why not place a stent?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Patients do very well with angioplasty alone, no reason to place a
  stent.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Lesion is so fibrotic that the pressure gradient cannot be
    obliterated with an angioplasty, a stent will not correct this
    problem

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Such patients should be referred for surgery.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Usually have stenoses in the mid and distal portions of the artery
  rather than at the ostium or proximal portion (as occurs with
  atherosclerosis).

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Should surgical revascularization become necessary due, for example,
    to in-stent restenosis, patients may require more complex branch
    repair to bypass the occluded stent since the stent often covers the
    renal artery up to the point of the first intrarenal branch.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Do we ever place stents?}

Two situations that may require stenting include dissection or
perforation (rare) after angioplasty.

\textbf{And we're getting good outcomes with PTA alone?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Technical (angiographic) success rates for PTA 83-100
\item
  Rate of restenosis 12-34\% over follow-up intervals of six months to
  two years

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Difficult to determine if patients with FMD develop restenosis, or
    if the lesion was not completely treated correctly the first time.
  \item
    Not necessarily associated with recurrent hypertension.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{But generally we can achieve significant and sustained
reductions in systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, serum
creatinine, and number of antihypertensive agents.}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Systolic blood pressure response was better in patients with FMD
  affecting the main renal artery than in patients with branch vessel
  involvement.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Any specific technical tips?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Cutting balloon angioplasty should be avoided because there is an
  increased risk of rupture
\item
  Post angioplasty visual inspection alone is \textbf{not} accurate.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Measure pressure differential using a pressure guidewire, with a
    mean gradient of \textless5 mmHg across the treated segment
    suggesting a satisfactory result

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Measure before and after angioplasty
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Post-procedure renal duplex scanning

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Degree of turbulence is less prominent, and velocity elevation in
      the mid-distal renal artery returns to normal.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) or optical coherence tomography
    (OCT) is occasionally used to evaluate the elimination or reduction
    of various endoluminal defects.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What should we do if it doesn't work?}

If either has no improvement in blood pressure or an initial improvement
followed by recurrence, repeat angiogram and PTA.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Restenosis may actually represent inadequate angioplasty during the
  first procedure
\end{itemize}

Persistent HTN despite technically successful PTA suggests that the
cause of hypertension is unrelated to fibromuscular disease or is
related to small vessel disease within the kidney (nephrosclerosis) due
to longstanding hypertension.

\textbf{What kind of complications do we see after this?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Mostly related to vascular access
\item
  Rarely: renal artery perforation, dissection, or segmental renal
  infarction may occur.
\item
  Decreasing over time- 16 \% in 1998 to 3 \% in 2001
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{surgery-2}{%
\subsubsection{Surgery}\label{surgery-2}}

\textbf{Lets switch gears to open revascularization?}

Aortorenal bypass with a saphenous vein graft is the most common
technique. Artificial graft material used occasionally.

\textbf{For everyone? What about for pediatric patients?}

Pediatric patients: hypogastric artery grafts are used or else aortic
reimplantation of the renal artery is performed because vein grafts
become aneurysmal

\textbf{How does this compare again to PTA?}

Similar success rates compared to PTA (82-89\% patency) but with higher
morbidity.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Perioperative mortality appears to be very low (\textasciitilde1.2\%)
\item
  Usually limited to complex cases so success and complication would
  probably be higher if simpler cases were included.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What does monitoring and follow-up look like for these
patients?}

Medical management only:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Renal artery stenosis and kidney dysfunction may progress despite good
  blood pressure control

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Mostly in patients with focal FMD and intimal fibroplasia
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Every patient with FMD should have measurement of serum creatinine and
  renal artery duplex ultrasound every 12 months.
\end{itemize}

After revascularization:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Duplex ultrasonography and serum creatinine measurements performed on
  the first office visit post procedure, then every six months for two
  years, and then yearly, if stable.
\item
  With worsening on new hypertension, or unexplained increase in the
  serum creatinine, he or she should be imaged at that time with duplex
  ultrasound (or CTA if the ultrasound is equivocal or poor quality).
\end{itemize}

\section{Renal Artery Aneurysms}\label{renal-artery-aneurysms}}

\hypertarget{demographics-14}{%
\subsection{Demographics}\label{demographics-14}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Renal artery aneurysms are rare - Autopsy studies have revealed an
  incidence of 0.01\% to 0.09\%.
\item
  Females \textgreater{} males, although females = males with FMD
  excluded
\item
  Although atherosclerotic changes have been identified in most
  aneurysms in patients with multiple lesions, this is not a uniform
  finding, suggesting that arteriosclerosis may not be the most
  important factor in the genesis of renal artery aneurysms.
\item
  More likely due to a congenital medial degenerative process with
  weakness of the elastic lamina.
\item
  Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is often a direct contributor to the
  development of an aneurysm.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Medial fibroplasia is typically associated with multiple stenoses
    and post-stenotic dilatation of the distal two thirds of the renal
    artery.
  \item
    Renal artery aneurysms in association with FMD are generally only a
    few millimeters in diameter.
  \item
    The typical angiographic appearance of a renal artery involved with
    medial fibroplasia is a ``string of beads.''
  \end{itemize}
\item
  A rare cause of renal artery aneurysms is Ehlers-Danlos' syndrome.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    This disorder is associated with extreme arterial fragility and
    spontaneous rupture.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{anatomy-5}{%
\subsection{Anatomy}\label{anatomy-5}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Most frequent site of involvement is primary bifurcation,
  intraparenchymal (\textless10\%)
\item
  Most are saccular
\item
  Right slightly more common than left, bilateral 10\%
\item
  90\% are extraparenchymal
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{presentation-8}{%

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Majority are associated with hypertension (70\%) (Coleman and Stanley
  2015)
\item
  10\% mortality
\item
  90\% risk of kidney loss
\item
  Less than 3\% rupture.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{management-23}{%
\subsection{Management}\label{management-23}}

\textbf{Size criteria currently controversial}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Uncontrolled hypertension is an indication for repair when smaller
  than 2.5cm. (Coleman and Stanley 2015)
\item
  VLFDC recently proposed a 3cm threshold for asymptomatic renal artery
  aneurysm. (Klausner et al. 2015)
\item
  Many aneurysms with circumferential calcification which could offer
  protection against rupture, however anecdotally calcification on
  imaging does not correlate to appearance of intraoperatively
\end{itemize}

In an elderly patient, observation of this aneurysm with Duplex
surveillance is the appropriate treatment.

For larger aneurysms in younger patients, aneurysmorrhaphy with primary
repair or patching, interposition grafting, or bypass can be performed
with low mortality. (Coleman and Stanley 2015)

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Comparison of ex vivo or insitu renal artery reconstruction have shown
  no difference in mortality, morbidity, LOS or reoperation.
\end{itemize}

Endovascular techniques such as coiling have been reported to be
successful in treating these saccular aneurysms; however, most aneurysms
occur at branch points making covered stent placement difficult.
(Coleman and Stanley 2015)

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Renal artery dissection caused by guide wires or catheters can occur,
  but is rare.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{demographics-15}{%
\subsection{Demographics}\label{demographics-15}}

\hypertarget{presentation-9}{%
\subsubsection{Presentation}\label{presentation-9}}

Renal ischemia from renal artery dissection should be considered if a
patient presents with acute onset of hypertension, flank pain, hematuria
and proteinuria. (B. T. Müller et al. 2003)

Renal artery dissection can sometimes be found incidentally on imaging
performed for other reasons.

\hypertarget{evaluation-13}{%
\subsection{Evaluation}\label{evaluation-13}}

CTA is the best modality of imaging because it is rapid and accurate at
diagnosis.

\hypertarget{management-24}{%
\subsection{Management}\label{management-24}}

If the patient has normal renal function, normal blood pressure or
stable hypertension, is asymptomatic or the dissection appears chronic,
then there likely is no role for intervention.

However, if emergent therapy is required if there is concern for renal
perfusion and viability.(Calligaro and Dougherty 2019) There is a role
for endovascular stenting, however endovascular therapy should be
avoided in the setting branch involvement.

Bypass, in situ repair, auto-transplant if renal branch involvement and
possibility of renal salvage. Nephrectomy may be required in
uncontrolled hypertension, extensive dissection and irreversable
ischemia.

Renal vein compression between the SMA and the aorta, often seen when
the SMA angle is \textless40 deg.(Yun et al. 2016)

\hypertarget{presentation-10}{%
\subsubsection{Presentation}\label{presentation-10}}

Classically presents with left flank pain and hematuria (microscopic and
macroscopic), and sometimes pelvic or vulvar varicosities. Symptoms are
often non-specific and other abdominal causes of pain should be
evaluated for simultaneously.

\hypertarget{evaluation-14}{%
\subsection{Evaluation}\label{evaluation-14}}

Often first identified on axial imaging with a narrowed renal vein and a
prominent ovarian vein. Definitive diagnosis often requires venogram and
absolute pressures.(K. W. Kim et al. 2011; Yun et al. 2016)

\hypertarget{management-25}{%
\subsection{Management}\label{management-25}}

Open surgery has been the mainstay of treatment, which usually requires
reconstruction of the renal vein to avoid compression. This can be done
with a transposition of the renal vein with or without a vein cuff or
transposition of the ovarian vein over the IVC.(Erben et al. 2015;
Kurklinsky and Rooke 2010; N. R. Reed et al. 2009)

Endovascular therapy with renal vein stenting has shown some promising
results but can be complicated by stent migration and fracture.
Antiplatelet therapy is recommended and there has been good patency out
to one year.(Erben et al. 2015; Ananthan, Onida, and Davies 2017;
Quevedo, Arain, and Abi Rafeh 2014; X. Wang et al. 2012)

\item
  Thrombectomy or thrombolysis reserved for acutely threatened kidney in
  young patient, complication of AC or thrombosis of solitary kidney
  with renal failure.
\item
  Nephrectomy for post-infarct hemorrhage.
\item
  Thrombolysis requires areterial and venous access - venous access to

  veins.
\end{itemize}

Vascular trauma requires close collaboration between vascular surgeons
and trauma surgeons. The decision of which specialty should manage which
injuries varies across different centers. Through these trauma chapters
we will discuss what management decisions the majority of vascular
surgeons should be comfortable managing as a part of a multidisciplinary
trauma team.

\hypertarget{general-principles}{%
\section{General Principles}\label{general-principles}}

As in all traumatic injuries, ensure that the patient is appropriately
resuscitated with supportive care.

It is important to consider the broad principles and approach:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Urgency of situation
\item
  Resuscitation Efforts
\item
  Communication with Team
\item
  Optimal Exposure
\item
  Appropriate Equipment
\end{enumerate}

Decision to maintain patency of a vessel vs.~ligation is dependent upon
the situation. During damage-control procedures where bleeding is not
controlled and location of hemorrhage not known, the inclination is to
ligate. The risk is organ ischemia, but the benefit would be patient
survival.

Angiography can be utilized in conjunction to open operative
explorations in areas of injury that are difficult to access/control
(i.e.~Zone 3 retroperitoneal hematomas)

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, arc=.35mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, bottomrule=.15mm, colback=white, titlerule=0mm, toprule=.15mm, breakable, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, left=2mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, opacityback=0, coltitle=black, toptitle=1mm, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-tip-color}{\faLightbulb}\hspace{0.5em}{Take a Look}, rightrule=.15mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm]

\textbf{General Guidelines of Penetrating vs.~Blunt Retroperitoneal
Exploration}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Zone I hematomas:} explore whether penetrating or blunt
  mechanism.
\item
  \textbf{Zone II hematomas:} always explore if penetrating, do not
  explore during blunt unless expanding. Kidneys are in Zone II and are
  in the lateral gutters.
\item
  \textbf{Zone III hematomas:} always explore if penetrating, do not
  explore during blunt unless expanding.

Procedural Sequence in Operative Abdominal Trauma

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Expose
\item
  Achieve Proximal Control
\item
  Explore and Evaluate Injury
\item
  Restore Flow
\end{itemize}

Supraceliac aortic and thoracic cross-clamping are important surgical
maneuvers to control massive intra-abdominal bleeding in hemodynamically
unstable patients.

\textbf{Tips and Tricks}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  In order to get umbilical tape or vessel loop around aorta, use
  combination of Metzenbaum scissors and controlled pressure.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    As you try to free the aorta from the connective tissue around it to
    get back to the spine, can use a metallic pediatric yankauer (small
    profile and blunt tip) as a dissection tool and push with the
    Metzenbaum scissors along with direct feel to get the aorta freed.
  \item
    Can then use a right angle to get underneath the aorta.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Ensure that lumbar vessels are identified when trying to get around
  the aorta

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    ``find the outside before you find the inside''
  \item
    Can clip lumbar vessels with medium/large Weck clips
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Use blue operative towels to cover and bring up the viscera to be held
  with the large retractors (i.e.~Omni retractor) so your hands are free
  to operate.
\item
  Spine exposures with orthopedic and neurosurgical colleagues and
  transplant procurements are also a great opportunity to learn the
  tenets of rotating the viscera either right or left and exposing the
  retroperitoneum
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, arc=.35mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, bottomrule=.15mm, colback=white, titlerule=0mm, toprule=.15mm, breakable, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, left=2mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, opacityback=0, coltitle=black, toptitle=1mm, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-tip-color}{\faLightbulb}\hspace{0.5em}{Take a Listen}, rightrule=.15mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm]

\hypertarget{supraceliac-control}{%
\subsection{Supraceliac Control}\label{supraceliac-control}}

Supraceliac control is recommended prior to any medial visceral
rotations if it is a Zone I hematoma.

\textbf{Exposure}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Basics

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Exposure starts with midline laparotomy incision from xiphoid to
    pubis that may be extended to the first 2-3 cm of a sternotomy.

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      This releases the inferior costal margins of the thoracic area
      under the diaphragm to pull the costal margins laterally and up --
      which suspends the patient's rib cage up and away from the aorta
      and the abdominal contents
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Recommend use of Omni retractor so that retractors can be placed
    under costal margin
  \item
    Ensure that there is nasogastric tube placed by anesthesia

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Allows circumferential control of esophagus with either umbilical
      tape or penrose drain for appropriate left-sided retraction of the
      esophagus, away from the crus that is surrounding the aorta
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Steps

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Midline laparotomy incision supraxiphoid to pubis with release of
    costal margin (suspended away from abdominal contents)
  \item
    Clear left lateral segment of liver by mobilizing left lateral
    segment either cephalad or tucked inferiorly to the right side.
  \item
    For better exposure, place patient in reverse Trendelenburg to let
    the stomach down and pull it inferiorly to create a better window

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Esophagus is retracted to the patient's left and the stomach
      pulled down (further retraction can be performed by a resident or
      operative assistant by putting their hand on the stomach and
      retracting it towards the pelvis)
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Next, divide the crus overlying the aorta, using a large right angle
    and a bovie extender

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Maintain adequate control during muscle dissection by feeling the
      aorta and its pulse (even a weak pulse)
    \item
      Divide the crus over the aorta with electrocautery and with blunt
      dissection on either side.
    \item
      Note: do not need to spend time to get circumferential control of
      the aorta like in an elective aneurysm repair.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Supraceliac aorta should now be exposed enough on either side to
    have a clamp appropriately placed to gain control
  \end{itemize}

  is suspected
\item
  Designed to give optimal exposure of the para-visceral segment of the
  aorta
\item
  The para-visceral segment of the aorta includes the supraceliac
  segment all the way down to the aortic bifurcation, primarily the left
  common iliac artery
\item
  Steps

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Divide the white line of Toldt along the sigmoid colon and the left
    colon.
  \item
    Establish plane in the retroperitonium

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Achieved through steady blunt dissection facilitated with Bovie
      electrocautery
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    The dissection plane is taken from the sigmoid/left colon up to
    divide the attachments ingrained in the spleen and the left kidney,
    then to the mid-line and then ultimately to the patient's right.
  \item
    Left kidney is almost always brought up

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      It is generally easier and faster, because you do not have to take
      the time to find the plane above the left kidney
    \end{itemize}

\textbf{Right medial visceral rotation (Cattell-Braasch Maneuver)}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Important when concerned about an IVC injury
\item
  Steps

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Divide the white line of Toldt starting at the cecum and coming
    along the right colon.
  \item
    Bring the cecum and right colon cephalad and then to the patient's
    left.

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Note: it is actually not so much of a rotation to the midline and
      then the left, but bringing everything up cephalad and then left
      to the patient's left costal margin --- almost bringing the cecum
      and right colon up onto the patient's left chest.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    This plane is similar to the left medial visceral rotation as it is
    largely developed with blunt dissection in combination with Bovie
    electrocautery to open the retroperitoneum.
  \item
    At this point, you will almost immediately see the left iliac vein
    and then the vena cava.
  \item
    Continue to bring the left colon up until you see the right renal
    vein and kidney.

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      At the superior extent, this will expose the head of the pancreas
      and duodenum.
    \end{itemize}

\hypertarget{exposure-of-infrarenal-aorta}{%
\subsection{Exposure of Infrarenal
Aorta}\label{exposure-of-infrarenal-aorta}}

The exposure of the infrarenal aorta is also called the transperitoneal
inframesocolic exposure

Inframesocolic means that the transverse colon is reflected cephalad.

Steps

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Hold up the transverse colon and drape it up cephalad to patient's
  costal margin (can be held up with a blue towel and retractor).
\item
  Divide the ligament of Treitz (by the surgeon on the patient's right)
  and get down to the fourth portion of the duodenum which should be to
  the left of patient's midline.
\item
  Once divided, the left colon remains on the patient's left and
  everything else goes to patient's right.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Note: this is not a medial visceral rotation because only the fourth
    portion of the duodenum and all of the small bowel is partitioned to
    patient's right.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  At this point, one should see the infrarenal aorta. The left renal
  vein is the most cephalad extent and the aortic bifurcation is the
  most caudal extent (located at root of colon mesentery).
\item
  The left renal vein can be ligated if necessary to facilitate aortic
  control

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Note: try to preserve the branches of the left renal vein that drain
    the left kidney (gonadal and lumbar) so that dividing the left renal
    vein is not as much of a detriment to the kidney
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{celiac-artery}{%
\subsection{Celiac Artery}\label{celiac-artery}}

\textbf{Exposure}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Origin of the celiac artery can be seen with left medial visceral
  rotation.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    This maneuver will expose the entire paravisceral segment of the
    aorta
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Can also use anterior approach through the lesser sac (very similar to
  exposure needed for the supraceliac aortic exposure)

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Stomach is retracted caudally towards the pelvis, lesser sac is
    opened, and then the stomach is pulled down further.
  \item
    Pancreas is pulled down as well and the origin of the first
    centimeter of the celiac artery is now exposed.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Repair}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Small and proximal injuries to celiac - Primary repair may be an
  option use 4-0 or 5-0 prolene sutures.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Ligation}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Large injuries with destruction of vessel wall - Primary repair may
  not be an option
\item
  Considered as damage-control situation to control bleeding and
  ligation considered as an initial step to save a patient's life
\item
  Ligation may be tolerated if there is robust GDA collateral
  circulation. However, once bleeding is controlled, this should be
  assessed with doppler.
\item
  If the patient is stable or improving and particularly if there is
  clear signs of liver, pancreas or duodenal ischemia, then this should
  be reconstructed.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{common-hepatic-artery-cha}{%
\subsection{Common Hepatic Artery
(CHA)}\label{common-hepatic-artery-cha}}

\textbf{Exposure}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Best visualized through that similar transperitoneal anterior approach
  for exposure of the celiac artery through the lesser sac.
\item
  Prior to identifying the common hepatic, you have to find the celiac
  and follow the branches
\item
  Recommend positioning in reverse Trendelenberg, the stomach inferior,
  and costal margins flared up to have the appropriate space

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    This will expose the second and third portions of the celiac artery,
    and its major branches --- including the common hepatic.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  The common hepatic artery can not be visualized using left medial
  visceral rotation.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Repair}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Primary repair is ideal
\item
  Ligation may be only option in damage control surgery

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    If possible, ligation of the common hepatic proximal to the GDA is
    preferable as there will be retrograde flow from the GDA into the
    proper hepatic to maintain the viability of the duodenum, pancreas,
    and liver.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{gastroduodenal-artery-gda}{%
\subsection{Gastroduodenal Artery
(GDA)}\label{gastroduodenal-artery-gda}}

\textbf{Exposure}

The gastroduodenal artery is the first branch off of the common hepatic
artery and defines the junction between the common and proper hepatic
arteries.

\textbf{Repair}

Primary repair should be sought if possible. If it is a damage control
situation, then the GDA must be ligated to control hemorrhage.

\textbf{Ligation}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Assess patient's condition, resuscitate, utilize the doppler, and
  assess the area distal to ligation to evaluate the consequences
\item
  If ligation showed appropriate collaterals, then the vessel can remain
  ligated
\item
  If there is clear ischemia, then there is a difficult decision between
  repair vs.~shunt vs.~permanent ligation
\item
  Consider metabolic consequences of ligation as well.
\item
  Decision is situationally dependent - the principles of damage control
  resuscitation and damage control surgery should always be maintained.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{splenic-artery}{%
\subsection{Splenic Artery}\label{splenic-artery}}

One of the key tenets of splenic injury is exposure. Ensure good
retraction with incision up to xiphoid and alongside the left costal
margin.

Low threshold for splenectomy for control of hemorrhage from the splenic
artery or splenic parenchyma.

\hypertarget{superior-mesenteric-artery-sma}{%
\subsection{Superior Mesenteric Artery
(SMA)}\label{superior-mesenteric-artery-sma}}

It is important to remember that a majority of these axial injuries are
typically unsurvivable and proximal SMA repair is uncommon in the trauma
setting. Even if the SMA is repaired and the bowel appears viable, it is
preferred to delay abdominal closure and perform a second look 24-36
hours later or sooner depending on the patient's condition.

\textbf{SMA is divided into 3 segments based on its course}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Segment 1: Aorta to Pancreas
\item
  Segment 2: Pancreas to Root of Mesentery
\item
  Segment 3: Mesentery to Small Bowel
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Exposure}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Visualization is dependent on the segment that needs to be exposed
\item
  Segment 1 (most proximal) - left medial visceral rotation.
\item
  Segment 2 (near head of pancreas)

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Head of pancreas may need to be divided to get appropriate exposure
  \item
    If distal to head of pancreas, can use inframesocolic approach
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Segment 3 (most distal) - anterior transperitoneal approach
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Repair}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  All efforts should be made to maintain flow through the SMA
\item
  Primary repair - performed on small injuries with 4-0 or 5-0 prolene
  suturing
\item
  Patchy angioplasty of interposition graft

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    For larger injuries
  \item
    Conduit types: PTFE, Dacron, or autologous tissue such as proximal
    greater saphenous vein or deep femoral vein
  \item
    Autologous vein is preferred in contaminated field, but can also use
    rifampin-soaked Dacron.
  \item
    Tunneling is dependent on location, proximal segments would need 6-8
    mm of graft while distal segments would need 3-4 mm.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Again, repair in a strictly traumatic setting is rare, because
  injuries that include the proximal mesenteric arteries are unlikely to
  be survivable. However, these techniques can be applied to other
  situations when assisting other surgeons who have to resect the SMA as
  a part of an oncologic resection or have induced an iatrogenic injury.

\textbf{Ligation}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Distal SMA segments may be more tolerant of ligation.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{inferior-mesenteric-artery-ima}{%
\subsection{Inferior Mesenteric Artery
(IMA)}\label{inferior-mesenteric-artery-ima}}

IMA can be ligated in majority of cases.

Prior to ligation, assess the patency of the iliac vessels ---
specifically the internal iliac vessels.

If both celiac and SMA are patent, then the IMA ligation can be
tolerated.

If there is concern for atherosclerotic disease or occlusion in the
internal iliacs, then ligation may not be the preferred option and
re-implantation may be considered.

For more discussion of evaluation and re-implantation of the IMA, see
Section~\ref{sec-aaa-open-repair}

\hypertarget{renal-arteries}{%
\subsection{Renal Arteries}\label{renal-arteries}}

Renal artery is unlikely to be reconstructed in a trauma setting
(similar to SMA)

Most commonly, if there is an expanding hematoma in Zone II and the
renal artery/parenchyma is damaged and confirmed as source of
hemorrhage, a nephrectomy is warranted and there is no indication for
repair.

In renal trauma, the renal artery is either not injured (with only
injury to renal parenchyma) or renal artery is injured and thrombosed.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If renal artery thrombosed, salvageability is unlikely due to
  prolonged warm ischemic time of the kidney.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Repair}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Occurs if source of hemorrhage is from an injured renal artery that
  still has flow

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Seen during exploration of expanding hematoma in Zone II
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Most commonly, if renal artery is injured it is ligated for
  damage-control
\item
  If patient hemodynamically stable, primary repair recommended

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    4-0, 5-0, or even 6-0 monofilament prolene suture
  \item
    If a primary repair would compromise the lumen, then consider patch
    angioplasty
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Distal branch artery injuries can be managed with endovascular coil
  embolization.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Again, the decision to take the time to coil embolize is dependent
    on the patient's current hemodynamics
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Incidental CT findings}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Types: intimal flap, fistula, and/or possible pseudoaneurysm of the
  renal artery
\item
  Management

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    The injury can be observed if there is continued renal perfusion and
    no flow limitation.
  \item
    If it is a flow limiting injury with more than 50\% stenosis caused
    by the intimal flap, it may be amenable to endovascular placement of
    bare metal stent to tack down the flap.
  \end{itemize}

For the discussion today we will divide the IVC into four segments:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Infrarenal
\item
  Renal/suprarenal
\item
  Retrohepatic
\item
  Suprahepatic
\end{itemize}

We will then discuss management of portal vein and SMV separately.

\hypertarget{non-operative-management}{%
\subsection{Non-operative management}\label{non-operative-management}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Generally well-tolerated due to low pressure system and difficulty of
  exposure increasing risk of more bleeding

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Especially for suprarenal and retrohepatic segments
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Option for blunt mechanism of injuries
\item
  If patient is hemodynamically stable and there are no other associated
  injuries, can consider non-operative management with serial imaging
  (CT with contrast)
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{hemorrhage-control}{%
\subsection{Hemorrhage Control}\label{hemorrhage-control}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Pre-operative planning with appropriate resuscitation and blood
  products available
\item
  Keep in mind coordination with other surgical teams and anesthesia
\item
  Patients with abdominal venous injuries likely to be polytrauma
  patients, approach to assess and repair injuries should be time
  efficient
\item
  IVC injuries considered Zone I retroperitoneal hematomas
\item
  Follow general principles of gaining proximal and distal control

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Can use low profile sponge sticks (Kittner sponge stick) or manual
    pressure
  \item
    Be prepared to refine where you control as the dissection progresses
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Immediate control of hemorrhage may require ligation. However, once
  the field is cleared, coordinate with anesthesia to confirm they are
  making progress with resuscitation and then evaluate whether the
  patient can tolerate reconstruction at that time or whether you need
  to continue to follow damage control principles.
\item
  Iliac vein injury often able to be accessed by ligating the internal
  iliac artery and mobilizing the common and external iliac artery.
  Transection of iliacs should only be used as a last resort if this
  fails. (J. T. Lee and Bongard 2002)

  \end{itemize}
\item
  Recommend figure of 8 of 16 to repair with 4-0 prolene suture on SH
  (small half circle) needle

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Larger needles are easier to visualize in cases with high amounts of
    bleeding
  \item
    When first suture is placed, recommend lifting on either side of
    suture with both strands to elevate the defect and maintain tension

This is a low pressure system and therefore non-operative management can

\item
  Empirical 4-compartment fasciotomies of lower extremities is dependent

\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{exposure-1}{%
\subsection{Exposure}\label{exposure-1}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Right medial visceral rotation (Cattell-Braasch) and mobilizing liver

\item
  Liver mobilization may be required to adequately expose this portion
  of the IVC as it is below the hepatic veins but posterior to the liver
  parenchyma.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Divide the attachments of the liver to the diaphragm to be able to
    move liver cephalad

Non-operative management is preferred due to the location of injury.
\textbf{The liver provides hemostasis due to overlying pressure and if

\hypertarget{exposure-2}{%
\subsection{Exposure}\label{exposure-2}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Right medial visceral rotation (Cattell-Braasch) and mobilizing liver

  for better visualization.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{hemorrhage-control-2}{%
\subsection{Hemorrhage Control}\label{hemorrhage-control-2}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  As in the more inferior segments of the IVC, it is important to
  control venous inflow from the more inferior IVC and lumbar veins.
\item
  Direct control of the hepatic veins is difficult, so ongoing bleeding
  may may require Total Hepatic Isolation to locate bleeding behind the
  liver

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Total Hepatic Isolation is accomplished with vascular control of the
    porta hepatis with a Rommel tourniquet, also known as the Pringle
    maneuver.

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Portal Vein - Accounts for 70-80\% of hepatic inflow
    \item
      Hepatic Artery
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Finally, you need to control the suprahepatic segment of the IVC under
  the diaphragm to prevent back bleeding.
\item
  Other options for bleeding control if total hepatic isolation not
  successful

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Supraceliac aortic clamp

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Can be considered if bleeding continues to help identify injury
    \item
      Last option, usually unsurvivable
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  If vascular control is required for an extended period, then an
  Atriocaval Shunt (AKA Schrock shunt) may be required to maintain
  venous return to the right atrium and prevent cardiovascular
  collapse.(Schrock 1968)

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Can be accomplished with large chest tube with extra hole cut near
    base
  \item
    Chest tube clamped at base and inserted via purse string suture at
    the right atrial appendage \textgreater{} advanced to infrarenal IVC
  \item
    Place Rommel tourniquet below area of suprarenal IVC (above the

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Careful liver mobilization due to multiple branch points and high risk

disease}\label{pathogenesis-of-peripheral-arterial-disease}}

\textbf{What is Peripheral Artery Occlusive Disease (PAD)?}

Peripheral Arterial Disease encompasses extremity arterial disease but
generally is used to describe lower limb arterial occlusive disease.
Peripheral Artery Occlusive Disease (PAD) is a more specific term and
this encompasses atherosclerotic disease of the lower limb arteries.

The disease has a step-wise spectrum of presentations from asymptomatic
disease to intermittent claudication and finally chronic limb
threatening ischemia (CLTI) formerly known as Critical Limb Ischemia
(CLI) (Aboyans et al. 2018)

\textbf{What is the underlying pathophysiology of PAD?}

The understanding of the underlying pathophysiology which results in
occlusive arterial disease of the lower limb has evolved over the last
50 years. Atherosclerosis remains the main pathological process
resulting in occlusive disease with smoking being the primary modifiable
risk factor.\\
Although with the rising incidence of diabetes a second population of
patients with a significant PAD burden has developed.

Atherosclerosis begins with an injury to the intimal lining of the
arterial wall, which, for example, can result from smoking,
hypertension, hyperglycemia, or advanced age. Repeated injury leads to a
chronic inflammatory process resulting in the uptake and oxidation of
LDL, resulting in foam cells.(Hiltunen et al. 1998; Tsimikas et al.
2005; Witztum 1994) Foam cells result when unregulated scavenger
receptors promote uptake of oxidized LDL by macrophages and smooth
muscle cells. These foam cells become necrotic and then create the
central core of the atheroma.(Owens 2019) This oxidized LDL form into
intimal plaque, build up and calcification that may result in
progressive vessel stenosis and subsequent occlusion, or plaque rupture
with acute occlusion.

Atherosclerosis is particularly prone to developing at sites of arterial
bifurcation (i.e.~carotid bifurcation, femoral bifurcation) because
turbulent flow and low laminar shear stress results in the down
regulation of eNOS and NO production. This in turn increases V-CAM-1 and
reduces inhibition of KF-kB (resulting in it's elevation.(Owens 2019)

\textbf{What are the risk factors for atherosclerosis?}

\textbf{Modifiable:}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{\emph{Smoking}}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    The \textbf{most significant modifiable risk factor} for developing
    peripheral arterial disease.
  \item
    Causes endothelial dysfunction by reducing nitric oxide and
    triggering reactive-oxygen species, platelet adhesion, and
    permeability of endothelial surface to fibrinogen.(United States
    Surgeon General 2014; Hackam and Anand 2003).
  \item
    Causes a prothrombotic environment by causing an increase in
    thromboxane A2 and decreasing prostacyclin thus overall resulting in
    increased prothrombotic environment for platelets.
  \item
    Smoking has a stronger association with Intermittent claudication
    than with Coronary Artery Disease(Gordon and Kannel 1972)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{\emph{Diabetes, Metabolic Syndrome, and Insulin Resistance}}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Diabetes Mellitus, after smoking, is the most significant modifiable
    risk factor for developing peripheral arterial disease. Both insulin
    resistance and hyperinsulinemia are independent risk factors for
    developing peripheral arterial disease. Increasing Incidence of
    Diabetes world-wide.(Boulton et al. 2005)

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      2.8\% of the global population affected by diabetes in 2000,
      estimated to be 4.4\% by 2030.
    \item
      25\% of patients with diabetes develop a diabetic foot ulcer
      (DFU), at some stage in their lives.
    \item
      Diabetic foot ulcers have a very high rate of recurrence with 40\%
      of patients developing a new ulcer within 12 months of healing a
      previous ulcer. (D. G. Armstrong, Boulton, and Bus 2017)
    \item
      Limb Loss occurs every 20 seconds world-wide to due to Diabetes
      related PAD or infection.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    The Odds Risk for developing PAD in patients with DM ranges from
    1.89 to 4.05.
  \item
    Factors associated with developing PAD in diabetics include female
    gender, chronicity/severity of DM, insulin dependence, African
    American race or Hispanic ethnicity.(Regensteiner et al. 2015;
    Selvin et al. 2006; Wattanakit et al. 2005) An increase in HbA1C by
    1\% correlates with a 28\% increase risk of developing PAD. (Amanda
    I. Adler et al. 2002)
  \item
    The following mechanisms may lead to PAD in diabetics

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Hyperglycemia reduces bioavailability of NO, which is a
      vasodilator, enhances endothelial function, and inhibits both
      platelet activation and smooth muscle migration.(Higashi et al.
      2009)
    \item
      Hyperglycemia activates protein kinase C and thus accumulation of
      mitochondrial ROS and prostanoids.(Geraldes and King 2010)
    \item
      Endothelial dysfunction leads to increased endothelin-1 and
      vasoconstriction.(Ahlborg et al. 2007)
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Given the pathological effect of diabetes upon multiple structures
    and systems the normal progressive history of diabetes related PAD
    is somewhat different to smoking related PAD. Clinically due to the
    combined effect of peripheral neuropathy and microvascular arterial
    disease, foot ulceration for many patients tends to be the initial
    presentation. This results in a lack of a `safety net' where
    presenting with progressive claudication allows for a period of
    detection, management and and risk factor modification before they
    develop tissue loss and are at risk of amputation, leading to poor
    outcomes and greater morbidity and mortality. (D. L. Armstrong et
    al. 2012)

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Neuropathy. The loss of the basic nociceptive mechanisms in the
      foot among diabetics, presents as a loss of protective sensation
      (LOPS). Neuropathy can be divided into three types:

      \begin{itemize}
      \item
        Sensory: ``stocking-glove'' distribution
      \item
        Motor: Intrinsic muscle wasting -- resulting in deformities
      \item
        Autonomic: Sympathetic nervous system pathology
      \end{itemize}

  \textbf{\emph{The Framingham Heart Study}}: The original Cohort from
  the town of Framingham, n=5183 patients, followed over time for over
  30 years. There have been multiple subsequent recruited populations
  since. The majority of information we have about risk factors related
  to cardiovascular health comes from this study. (Mahmood et al. 2014)

\item
  \textbf{\emph{The Edinburgh Study}}: The EAS began as a cross
  sectional study of 1592 men and women in Edinburgh with the goal of
  examining the frequency of risk factors for peripheral arterial

\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{intermittent-claudication}{%
\section{Intermittent Claudication}\label{intermittent-claudication}}

\textbf{What is Intermittent Claudication and the classic patient
presentation?}

The original population studies we mentioned determined the epidemiology
and natural history of Intermittent Claudication based on historically
validated and widely accepted questionnaires, namely the
\textbf{\emph{Rose}} (Rose 1962) (which later was adopted by the WHO)
and subsequently the \textbf{\emph{Edinburgh questionnaire}}. (Lend and
Fowkes 1992).

All questionnaires are based on a number of key diagnostic clinical
factors that define claudication, they are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Onset
\item
  Calf Involvement
\item
  Reproducibility
\item
  Relief with Rest
\item
  Not Occurring at Rest
\end{itemize}

The progression of intermittent claudication was historically graded by
Fontaine (1954) (Fontaine, Kim, and Kieny 1954) followed by the
Rutherford Grading System (1986, Revised 1997) (Rutherford et al. 1997)

\textbf{Leriche Syndrome} - Is a clinical triad of: claudication
(buttock, thigh, and calf), impotence, and decreased lower limb pulses,
which signifies aortoiliac occlusive disease. (Frederick, Newman, and
Kohlwes 2010; Leriche and Morel 1948; Setacci et al. 2012)

\textbf{Neurogenic Claudication} - Differentiating neurogenic
claudication from vasculogenic claudication can be difficult.
Vasculogenic claudication is relieved by cessation of ambulation and
mostly affects a unilateral calf. Neurogenic improves with postural
changes, more often bilateral and affects the thighs. (Nadeau et al.
2013)

\hypertarget{evaluation-17}{%

\textbf{What is involved in the work up of patients with
PAD/Intermittent Claudication?}

\textbf{\emph{SVS Guidelines:}}

``We recommend using ABPI as the first-line non-invasive test to
establish a diagnosis of PAD in individuals with symptoms or signs
suggestive of disease. When the ABI is borderline or normal
(\textgreater0.9) and symptoms of claudication are suggestive, we
recommend an exercise ABPI.''(Conte, Pomposelli, Clair, Geraghty,
McKinsey, Mills, Moneta, Murad, Powell, Reed, and al. 2015)

\emph{Grade 1 Level of Evidence A}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  ABPI
\item
  Exercise ABPI
\item
  Ultrasound
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What is an ABPI and how is it measured?}

The AHA released guidelines on how to perform an ABPI in an attempt to
standardize the method to allow for more comparable results from
studies:

Divide the higher of the PT or DP pressure by the higher of the right or
left Brachial SBP \emph{(Class 1 Level of Evidence A)} (Aboyans et al.
2012)

Sensitivity and Specificity both \textgreater95\% (when ABPI cut off
\textless/=0.9 -- in detecting \textgreater/= 50\% stenosis) (Yao,
Hobbs, and Irivne 2005; K. Ouriel et al. 1982)

\end{longtable}

Patients with diabetes may have non-compressible tibial vessels and
therefore toe pressures can be particularly useful in this population.

Segmental pulse volume recordings (PVR) can provide information about
the quality of perfusion at the level of the thigh or calf helping to
localize the likely level of occlusive disease.

\textbf{What are Exercise ABPI studies?}

Constant Load Testing -- (unlike the Graded Test -- Bruce Protocol used
in testing for coronary artery disease).

The physiological changes in ABPI related to exercise are due to the
fact that exercise increases SBP and decreases SVR and, therefore, will
affect flow through a stenosis making it more physiologically relevant
during exercise and result in a decreased pressure in the lower
extremity. (Nicolaï et al. 2009; Alqahtani et al. 2018)

Walking distance has been shown to correlate with level and severity of
POAD. (Strandness and Sumner 1975)

Furthermore patients with single level iliac disease may present with
buttock/thigh claudication with preserved pulses. Exercise treadmill
ABPI is particularly useful in determining the severity of disease in
these patients. (Aboyans et al. 2010) For more on exercise testing see

    asymptomatic, they had other risk factors such as diabetes, IHD,
    cerebrovascular disease, or hypertension. Without these risk factors
    the benefit of Statin therapy remains unclear.
  \item
    However, the AHA from the Framingham Study does recommend using
    statins if 10-year risk based on risk calculators \textgreater7.5\%
    (which would be positive if PAD present).

\textbf{How can we medically manage Intermittent Claudication based on
the SVS Guidelines?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Smoking Cessation:} As in with asymptomatic disease above,
  multidisciplinary comprehensive smoking cessation interventions --
  repeatedly until tobacco use has stopped \emph{(Grade A -- 1)}
\item
  \textbf{Dyslipidaemia:} Statin Therapy Recommended -- most recent
  evidence on lipid therapy has suggested focusing on reducing 10-year
  cardiovascular event risk rather than specifically reducing lipid
  levels. \emph{(Grade 1-A)}
\item
  \textbf{Anti-Platelet Therapy:} Aspirin therapy (75-325mg daily) is
  recommended to reduce cardiovascular events in patients with PAD
  \emph{(Grade 1-Level A)} (Antithrombotic Trialists'Collaboration 2002;
  Antithrombotic Trialists'(ATT) Collaboration et al. 2009)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Literature reviews find benefits in secondary prevention with
    antiplatelet monotherapy (aspirin or clopidogrel) in symptomatic
    PAD.(Banerjee et al. 2015) Some initial studies did demonstrate
    benefit from vorapaxar as well.(Rooke et al. 2013)
  \item
    There is evidence that Clopidogrel 75mg compared to Aspirin is
    better in event reduction. (CAPRIE)(Committee 1996a)-- replacing
    Aspirin with Clopidogrel \emph{(Grade 1-Level B)}
  \item
    Recent evidence from the COMPASS trial has suggested that the
    addition of low dose rivaroxaban (2.5mg BID) to aspirin (100mg
    daily) has lower MALE, composite endpoint of cardiovascular death,
    stroke and MI. Subgroup analysis suggested clopidogrel may be better
    with reduced risk of GI bleed and MACE.(Anand et al. 2018; Eikelboom
    et al. 2017)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Diabetes Mellitus:} Optimization of HbA1C \textless{} 7\%
  \emph{(Grade 1-Level B)}(Lajoie 2019)
\item
  \textbf{Hypertension}: Indicated B-Blockers for hypertension.
  \emph{(Grade 1-Level B)}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    There's no evidence that beta blockers worsen the symptoms of
    intermittent claudication, but the patients should be monitored for
    episodes of hypotension
  \item
    Initiation of beta-blockers in the immediate preoperative period is
    associated with worse outcomes.(Blessberger et al. 2018; P. S. Group
    et al. 2008)
  \item
    ACE Inhibitors are first line in patients with heart failure,
    diabetes or kidney disease but should be avoided in patients with
    renal artery stenosis (RAS).(Barrons and Woods 2016)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Homocysteine}: While higher homocysteine levels are associated
  with PAD and risk of venous and arterial thrombosis.(D'Angelo and
  Selhub 1997; Khandanpour et al. 2009; Liebman 2019) Recommendation
  against Folic Acid and Vit B12\emph{(Grade 2 -- C)}
\item
  Patients are at higher risk of depression (almost 20\%), therefore
  PHQ-9 and -2 are good screening tools and should be use in these
  patients.(Jha et al. 2019; McDermott et al. 2016; J. L. Ramirez,
  Drudi, and Grenon 2018)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{To improve Limb Function in patients with Claudication:}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Cilostozol} use -- Claudication without CHF -- 3-month Trial
  (Grade 2 - A)

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    If unable to tolerate Cilostozol -- Pentoxifylline (400mg TDS)
    \emph{(Grade 2 -- B)}
  \item
    Based on Meta-analysis 26 trials (Stevens et al. 2012)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Supervised Exercise Therapy}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    First Line Therapy recommended SEP: minimum three times per week
    (30-60 min/session) for at least 12 weeks (\emph{Grade 1 Level A})
  \item
    More durable functional improvements than angioplasty alone, however
    no current data demonstrating impact on need for revascularization
    or amputation rate.(F. Fakhry et al. 2013; Farzin Fakhry et al.
    2015; T. P. Murphy et al. 2012, 2015)
  \item
    Meta-analysis of 32 RCTs: Placebo versus exercise: Walking Time,
    Walking Ability, Pain Free Walking and maximum walking distance
    improves. BUT no difference in ABPI, Mortality or amputation. (Lane

\subsubsection{Open and Endovascular
Management}\label{open-and-endovascular-management}}

\textbf{What is the surgical management for patients with Intermittent
Claudication?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  With appropriate medical management and risk modification, 25\% of
  patients will improve, 50\% will remain stable and 25\% will progress
  and requiring intervention. (Conte, Pomposelli, Clair, Geraghty,
  McKinsey, Mills, Moneta, Murad, Powell, Reed, and al. 2015; Norgren et
  al. 2007)
\item
  Patient Selection for Intervention:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    As above, 20-30\% of patients with IC who adhere to risk factor
    modification will have progressive symptoms that will eventually be
    treated with intervention.
  \item
    Patient selection should be based on QoL and functional impairment
    in an active person (loss of ability to perform occupation or that
    limits basic activities of daily living) rather than hemodynamic
    (ABPI or US) or anatomical disease progression/severity.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Always remember multifactorial causes of immobility -- particularly in
  the elderly.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    SVS recommends that invasive therapy for IC have a \textgreater50\%
    likelihood of sustained clinical improvement for at least 2 years.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Anatomical Selection:}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \textbf{\emph{Aortoiliac Disease:}} Previous TASC Classification has
    attempted to categorize anatomy of disease and subsequent
    recommendation of Endovascular versus open surgery. But as the
    authors of the SVS guidelines highlight, ``improvements in
    technology and endovascular techniques have resulted in EVT
    replacing open surgical bypass as a primary treatment for both focal
    and advanced AIOD in many cases.'' \textbf{The majority of evidence
    is non randomized and meta analyses of non-randomized series.}

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Endovascular procedures is preferred as primary thearpy over open
      surgery for focal aortoiliac, common Iliac and external iliac
      disease causing Claudication. \emph{(Grade 1 Evidence B)}
    \item
      Hybrid approaches are recommended for Iliac disease involving CFA
      with the addition of an open femoral endarterectomy. \emph{(Grade
      1 Level B)}
    \item
      Direct Surgical reconstruction (bypass, endarterectomy) in
      patients with reasonable surgical risk and diffuse aortoiliac
      occlusive disease not amenable to endovascular approach, after one
      or more failed attempts at EVT, or combined occlusive and
      aneurysmal disease. \emph{(Grade 1 Evidence B)}
    \item
      Bilateral external iliac occlusion may be best treated with end to
      side aorto-bifemoral bypass to allow for continued perfusion of
      the pelvis. (Jaquinandi et al. 2008; Akker et al. 1992; Brewster
      and Darling 1978)
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    \textbf{\emph{Infrainguinal Disease:}} Reviewing historical data
    comparing all EVT compared with surgical bypass EVTs are less
    durable, especially when there's diffuse or long segments of
    occlusion/multilevel infrainguinal disease. \textbf{Most
    recommendations are based on low level evidence when comparing EVT
    versus Open Surgery}

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Endovascular therapy has become first line therapy for focal SFA
      disease not involving the vessel origin. \emph{(Grade 1 Level C)}
    \item
      Endovascular therapy with self-expanding stent (with or without
      paclitaxel) is recommended for SFA disease 5-15cm \emph{(Grade 1
      Level B)}

      \begin{itemize}
      \item
        After SFA stenting, SVS and ACC recommend at least 30d dual
        anti-platelet, then single anti-platelet or anti-platelet and
        rivaroxaban.(Hussain et al. 2018; Vascular Surgery Lower

\section{Guidelines}\label{guidelines-1}}

Much of the content here is adapted from the most recent \textbf{Global
vascular guidelines on the management of chronic limb-threatening
ischemia}(Conte et al. 2019).

In 2019 the SVS, the ESVS and the World federation of Vascular Societies
(WFVS) joined forces to put together the structure and funding of the
\textbf{\emph{Global Vascular Guidelines Initiative (GVG)}}. Importantly
all sponsorship was directly from the societies and any direct industry
sponsorship or external sources were excluded. They put together a
steering committee responsible for recruiting a large and diverse
writing group and outlined the scope and developed the section briefs of
the guideline.

They determined that:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  ``The term''critical limb ischemia'' (CLI) is outdated and fails to
  encompass the full spectrum of patients who are evaluated and treated
  for limb-threatening ischemia in modern practice.''
\item
  Chronic Limb Threatening Ischemai (CLTI) was promoted as the term of
  choice and was defined by the target population.
\item
  The target population were:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
  \item
    \textbf{\emph{Ischemic Rest Pain}} with confirmatory hemodynamic
    studies.
  \item
    \textbf{\emph{Diabetic Foot Ulcer}} or any lower limb ulceration
    present for at least 2 weeks.
  \item
    \textbf{\emph{Gangrene}} involving any portion of the lower limb or
    foot.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Exclusion from the population:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
  \item
    Purely Venous Ulcers
  \item
    Acute Limb Ischemia/acute trash foot/ischemia due to emboli
  \item
    Acute Trauma or mangled extremity
  \item
    Wounds secondary to non-atherosclerotic conditions
  \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

Methodology of the guidelines utilized the structure of the
\textbf{\emph{GRADE}} certainty of evidence system.

They highlighted particular important sections in the evaluation and
management of patients with CLTI: \textbf{\emph{Patient Risk
stratification}}, \textbf{\emph{Limb Assessment and Severity of Limb
Threat}} and the development of a specific \textbf{\emph{evidence-based
revascularisation guideline in CLTI}}.

It is important to note that compared to most guidelines, unfortunately
in the management of CLTI, particularly when it comes to
revascularisation, the level of evidence is generally \textbf{LOW}.
Again, it is important to highlight that the significance of these
guidelines in developing a standard approach and appropriately
stratifying patients in not only management but ongoing research.

\subsection{Etiology and Presentation}\label{etiology-and-presentation}}

\textbf{How does PAD pathologically progress clinically into Chronic
Limb Threatening Ischemia (CLTI)?}

The latter stages of both the Rutherford and Fontaine Classification
systems highlight this progression, with the Rutherford classification
of Stage 5 being specifically minor tissue loss with focal gangrene, and
stage 6 as major tissue loss identified by spreading of gangrene beyond
the Trans metatarsal level.

\textbf{What is Chronic Limb Threatening Ischemia (CLTI), sometimes
previously known as Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)?}

In the last decade leading up to the 2021 Global Vascular Guidelines
(GVG), the term (Chronic Limb threatening Ischemia) CLTI has been
gradually replacing CLI. The GVG mentions that their ``promotion'' of
the term CLTI is partly due to terms such as ``critical or severe limb
ischemia'' failing to ``recognize the full spectrum and
inter-relatedness of components beyond ischemia that contribute to major
limb amputation\ldots{}''

\textbf{What was the original definition and threshold for CLI, and how
can we make sure we elicit the right symptoms from the patient?}

John Cranley back in his publication in 1969 defined Ischemic Rest Pain
as,

``\ldots pain that occurs in the toes or in the area of the metatarsal
heads. Occasionally\ldots in the foot proximal to the metatarsal heads.
Elevation of the limb above or at the horizontal position aggravates the
pain and pendency\ldots brings relief\ldots{}'' (Cranley 1969)

\textbf{\emph{Nocturnal Rest Pain:}} Worse due to horizontal positioning
(no gravitational assistance) and systolic BP drop during sleep.

\hypertarget{natural-history}{%
\subsection{Natural History}\label{natural-history}}

\textbf{What is the natural history of CLTI and what do we know about
its prognosis?}

Fortunately, only a small portion of patients with Intermittent
Claudication will go on to develop rest pain or tissue loss. Its
estimated that anywhere between 5\% -29\% of patients with PAD or IC go
on to develop CLTI over 5 years.

However, those that do develop CLTI, have a high risk of limb loss
(greater than 20\% annual risk).

Patients with CLTI have a high mortality risk (10-15\% annual risk), the
majority of terminal events being related to cardiovascular events. Limb
loss or mortality may reach as high as 50\% in 1 year. (Adam et al.
2005; Norgren et al. 2007)

\textbf{What has changed in the last few decades?}

Etiologically the prevalence of smokers(Ex and Current) in the
population has decreased and the prevalence of diabetes has increased.
For more details on the relationship between diabetes and pad, see
Section~\ref{sec-pad-risk-factors}

\hypertarget{wifi-classification}{%
\subsection{WIFi Classification}\label{wifi-classification}}

\textbf{What is the WIFI Classification?}

Interestingly in the original article by Bob Rutherford regarding
Diabetes and PAD:

- ``It was generally agreed that diabetic patients who have a varied
clinical picture of neuropathy, ischemia and sepsis make the definition
even more difficult and it is desirable that these patients be
excluded\ldots diabetic patients should be clearly defined as a separate
category or should be clearly defined as a separate category.''

Since then, the SVS, while acknowledging that we can no longer exclude
these patients and treat them separately given the overlap, have decided
that a new classification system is necessary, as one of the key authors
(Joseph Mills) states:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  ``We classify things into groups to differentiate, remember and
  compare, observe and predict their behavior over time.'' --Joseph
  Mills
\end{itemize}

\textbf{\emph{WIfI stands for: Wound, Ischemia and foot Infection}}.
Most of the existing Vascular and non-Vascular classification systems
don't include all three components or fail to stratify the degree of
ischemia and presence of gangrene.(Mills et al. 2014a)

Principles of WIfI:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{\emph{Grades, Classes and Stages}} -- Each of the three
  categories (WIfI) have Grades 0,1,2,3: Resulting in 64 Classes.
\item
  \textbf{\emph{Delphi Consensus}} -- Clinical Stages 1 (Very Low),2
  (Low), 3 (Moderate), 4 (High Risk/Benefit).

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \item
    What is the one-year risk of amputation with medical therapy alone?
  \item
    What is the potential benefit from successful revascularization?
  \item
    Analogous to TNM Staging
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

``It is intended to be an iterative process with the goal of more
precisely stratifying patients according to their initial disease
burden, analogous to TNM cancer staging, but not to dictate therapy.''

\hypertarget{differential-diagnosis}{%
\subsection{Differential Diagnosis}\label{differential-diagnosis}}

\textbf{What about a differential diagnosis or other causes of similar
pain as rest pain?}

Acute lower limb ischemia has a different clinical presentation, but
there may be some overlap with Acute on Chronic disease such as in the
case of in situ thrombosis in the lower limb arterial system.

Other causes of ischemic pain include:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Buergers Disease, or Thromboangiitis Obliterans - for more see
  Section~\ref{sec-buergers-disease}
\item
  Scleroderma
\item
  Fibromuscular Dysplasia - for more see
  Section~\ref{sec-fibromuscular-dysplasia}
\item
  Popliteal Artery Entrapment - for more see Section~\ref{sec-paes}
\item
  Cystic Adventitial Disease - for more see
  Section~\ref{sec-cystic-adventitial-disease}
\item
  Persistent Sciatic Artery Disease
\item
  Neurogenic pain
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What is the Rutherford Acute Ischemia Grading System?}

Although acute ischemia is very different from chronic ischemia,
patients with progressive chronic PAD can develop an acute picture
whether from embolism or in-situ thrombosis secondary to plaque rupture.
See Chapter~\ref{sec-acute-limb-ischemia} for more.

\hypertarget{evaluation-18}{%
\section{Evaluation}\label{evaluation-18}}

\textbf{What aspects of the clinical assessment is important?}

Clinical Assessment involves a full history (the differential mentioned
in Intermittent Claudication) and examination.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Clinical Examination:}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \textbf{\emph{Buergers Test (Buerger 1908) / AKA Ratschows Test}}
    (Max-Ratschow-Klinic) identifies when there is critical ischemia
    without necrosis yet or gangrene, and is characterized by pallor
    when the leg is elevated above the level of the heart, which then
    turns red when hanging down over the edge of the bed. This redness
    is referred to as ``Sunset appearance'' and its due to abnormal
    autoregulation. Its been described that normally only a third of the
    capillary bed is open at any time but in a state of critical
    ischemia because of the autoregulation being paralyzed a
    significantly higher portion of the capillaries open up.
  \item
    \textbf{\emph{The ischemic Angle:}} A refinement to Berger's Test:
    The angle of elevation from the horizontal at which the Doppler
    Signal of the PT or DP disappears. This is also referred to as the
    `pole test', whereby the foot is raised alongside a calibrated pole
    marked in mmHg.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Tissue Loss:}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Gangrene Dry or Wet (infection)
  \item
    Level of tissue Loss
  \item
    Probing To Bone/ Exposed structures: Tendons, Soft Tissue, bone,
    Joint Capsule.
  \item
    Examination of an Ulcer (may have many etiologies) -- important not
    only to identify extent of disease but also to exclude other
    etiologies:

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Such as venous, mixed, infective, autoimmune, inflammatory,
      malignancy or trauma.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Foot Infection} - Signs of infection, erythema, rubor,
  cellulitis, tenderness or unexplained hyperglycemia in diabetic
  patients should prompt urgent referral.(Kalish and Hamdan 2010)
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{physiologic-testing}{%
\subsection{Physiologic Testing}\label{physiologic-testing}}

\textbf{What other clinical evaluation is necessary for the patient with
CLTI?}

In addition to history, examination, and WIfI assessment mentioned
above, for patients with diabetes and an ulcer a full assessment of
neuropathy and a ``probe to bone'' test for any open ulcers is
recommended as part of good practice.

In the PAD and intermittent claudication sub chapters the non-invasive
methods of assessment for these patients have been discussed. In
addition it is important to emphasize the role of Toe Pressures (TP) and
Toe Pressure Index (TPI) in this cohort of patients.

CLTI measurements most predictive of non-healing are ankle pressure
\textless50mmHg, ABI \textless0.4, TcPO2 \textless20mmHg, and TP
\textless20mmHg.(Gerhard-Herman et al. 2017; Wickström et al. 2017).
Healing of an ulcer or tissue loss is unlikely if a patient's toe
pressures are less than 55mmHg. And Toe Pressures have been validated in
multiple studies to correlate with Amputation free survival and wound
healing: Amputation Free Survival TP \textless30mmHg 2.13 HR
(1.52-2.98). (Wickström et al. 2017; Hicks et al. 2018)

Patients with ESRD or DM develop medial calcification and often have
elevated ABPI (\textgreater1.3) - which is associated with an elevated
risk of cardiovascular mortality. Outcomes in patients with ESRD are
worse in relation to amputation free survival and amputation rates,
regardless of revascularization strategy.(Meyer et al. 2018) Toe
pressures are particularly important in this scenario. (Resnick et al.
2004; Vitti et al. 1994)

Regarding non-invasive assessment for wound healing, a TcPO2 greater
than 40mmHg has the greatest correlation with amputation stump
healing.(Malone et al. 1987)

\hypertarget{imaging-2}{%
\subsection{Imaging}\label{imaging-2}}

\textbf{What imaging assessment is required?}

The CLTI Guidelines outline an algorithm of attaining Arterial
Anatomical Imaging. Starting with US and then depending on the
information required, CTA, MRA, or eventually digital subtraction
angiography. They emphasize the importance of obtaining good quality
imaging to appropriately stage and be able to compare the level and
degree of disease.

For wounds with concern for underlying osteomyelitis - initial workup is
with plain radiography, which can identify soft tissue emphysema,
evidence of osteomyelitis, or presence of a foreign body. High suspicion
of early osteomyelitis with negative x-ray may warrant an MRI.(Giurato
et al. 2017)

The most recently published RCT in CLTI, BEST-CLI, highlights the good
outcomes of surgical bypass with saphenous vein, suggesting that vein
mapping also be considered a routine imaging study during the workup of
patients. This will help to clearly understand revascularization options
before attempting endovascular diagnostic or therapeutic
interventions.(Farber et al. 2022)

\textbf{What is the Global Limb Anatomic Staging System (GLASS)?} (Conte
et al. 2019)

Because the existing arterial anatomical staging of disease is vague,
``lesion focused'', and not all encompassing (beyond the concept of
`in-line pulsatile flow to the foot'), \textbf{GLASS} focuses on
infrainguinal disease, and attempts to incorporate all aspects in its
staging to improve vascular care and evidence-based revascularisation
(EBR) outcomes.~

GLASS is a grading system based on anatomical and subjective assessment
of calcification and incorporates two novel and important concepts:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  The Target Arterial Path (TAP)
\item
  Estimated Limb-Based Patency (LBP)
\end{enumerate}

As GLASS focuses on Infrainguinal disease, with the aortoiliac (AI)
segment considered the inflow disease which includes the Common Femoral
Artery and the Profunda Artery. Therefore, the GLASS grades assume the
inflow vessels are treated and adequately `dealt with'.~

Infrainguinal disease assessment for Femoropoliteal (FP) and
Infrapopliteal (IP) is based on length of disease and the extent of
CTOs. The FP and IP GLASS Grades are then combined into Stages 1-3.~

The calcification scale is a dichotomous subjective assessment of the
degree of calcification and if there is \textgreater50\% circumference
of calcification, diffuse or bulky calcification or ``coral reef''
plaques, then there is an increase in the within-segment grade by one
numerical value.

There is also mention of the Inframaleolar (IM) degree of disease (PO,
P1-absent arch, P2-no target artery crossing into foot) which is not
included in the GLASS staging given little evidence on the outcomes this
difference makes on overall patency and limb salvage.

Once the GRADES (0-4) of FP and IP disease are determined then staging
(1-3) can be performed based on the matrix or grid that is provided.
Staging then allows for est imated \textbf{Peripheral endoVascular
Intervention outcomes} (PVI) to be predicted, Immediate Technical
Failure (ITF - \textless10\% or \textless{} 20\% or \textgreater{}
20\%)) and 1-year Limb Based Patency (LBP - \textgreater70\%, 50-75\% or
\textless50\%).~

\textbf{What is the Target Arterial Path (TAP)?}

``The selected continuous route of in-line flow from groin to ankle. The
TAP typically involves the least diseased IP artery but may be angiosome
based.''

\textbf{What are the recommendations for patients with CLTI when it
comes to Medical Therapy and Risk Factor Modification?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Treat all patients with CLTI with an \textbf{antiplatelet} agent
  \emph{(Grade 1 Level A).} Consider \textbf{Clopidogrel} as the single
  agent (\emph{Grade 2 Level B}) -- CAPRIE(Committee 1996b)
\item
  \textbf{High-intensity statin therapy} to reduce all-cause and
  cardiovascular mortality - Atorvastatin 80mg or Rosuvastatin 40mg.
  These can be titrated down to atorvastatin 40mg or rosuvastatin 20mg
  if unable to tolerate. (\emph{Grade 1 Level A}) (Arya et al. 2018;
  Grundy et al. 2019)
\item
  Control \textbf{Hypertension} to BP target \textless140mm Hg systolic
  and \textless90mm Hg diastolic in patients with CLTI (\emph{Grade 1
  Level B})
\item
  Offer \textbf{Smoking Cessation} interventions and ask all smokers or
  former smokers about status of tobacco use every visit (\emph{Grade 1
  Level A})
\item
  \textbf{Diabetic foot wounds} with signs of infection, erythema,
  swelling, pain and foul smelling drainage should be investigated with
  plain radiography, ESR, CRP, cultures and, managed with iv
  antibiotics. Signs of systemic sepsis, such as fevers, tachycardia or
  shock, such as hypotension, should warrant urgent debridement and
  drainage, regardless of vascular status.

\hypertarget{endovascular-and-surgical-management}{%
\subsection{Endovascular and Surgical
Management}\label{endovascular-and-surgical-management}}

\textbf{Which revascularisation management strategies exist for CLTI?}

The mainstay of management for patients with CLTI have always been based
on the fundamental principle of limb salvage. Given the high risk of
limb loss in these patients there is a low threshold to revascularize
these patients if they have occlusive disease that is treatable. But
strategy has varied significantly.(Conte et al. 2019)

The CLTI Guidelines provide an approach to dealing with this complex
condition on planning three aspects to each case:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Patient Risk Estimation}
\item
  \textbf{Limb Staging}
\item
  \textbf{Anatomic Pattern of Disease}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{What is involved with the Patient Risk Estimation?}

\textbf{\emph{Good Practice Statements (Recommendations section 6)}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  ``Refer all patients with suspected CLTI to a vascular specialist for
  consideration of limb salvage, unless major amputation is considered
  medically urgent.''
\item
  ``Offer primary amputation or palliation to patients with limited life
  expectancy, poor functional status (e.g.~non ambulatory), or an
  unsalvageable limb after shared decision-making.''
\end{itemize}

\textbf{\emph{Recommendation 6.3:}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Estimate periprocedural risk and life expectancy in patients with CLTI
  who are candidates for revascularization. \emph{Grade 1 (Strong) Level
  of Evidence C (Low)}
\item
  Average Surgical Risk: \textless5\% operative mortality and 2-year
  survival \textgreater50\%
\item
  Severe Surgical Risk: \textgreater/= 5\% operative mortality and
  2-year survival \textless/=50\%
\end{itemize}

Understanding disparities is important when interpreting risk for
amputation. Observational studies have found certain populations to be
at higher risk of amputation regardless of disease severity. These
groups include African Americans, lowest median income, medicaid
insurance, uninsured, or those from regions with less access to vascular
surgeons.(K. Hughes et al. 2019; Ho et al. 2005; Eslami, Zayaruzny, and
Fitzgerald 2007)

\textbf{What is involved and recommended with the Limb Staging and
recommendation for Management?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Use an integrated threatened limb classification system (such as WIfI)
  to stage all CLTI patients who are candidates for limb salvage.
  \emph{Grade 1 (Strong) Level of Evidence C (Low)}
\item
  Perform urgent surgical drainage and debridement (including minor
  amputation if needed) and commence antibiotic treatment in all
  patients with suspected CLTI who present with deep space foot
  infection or wet gangrene. \emph{(Good Practice Statement)}
\item
  Offer Revascularisation to all ``average surgical risk patients''
  (\textbackslash\textless5\% operative mortality and 2-year survival
  \textgreater50\%) with advanced limb-threatening conditions (e.g.~WIfI
  stage 4) and significant perfusion deficits (e.g.~ischemia grades 2
  and 3). Particularly if they have good saphenous vein. \emph{Grade 1
  (Strong) Level of Evidence C (Low)} (Adam et al. 2005; Norgren et al.
  2007)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What is involved in the Planning of the Anatomic pattern of
disease and its effects of revascularisation strategy?}

The overall pattern of arterial occlusive disease is a dominant factor
in guiding type of revascularisation and timing of such.

\textbf{Do all patients require direct in-line flow to the foot as a
primary technical outcome with revascularisation?}

Patients with rest pain do not necessarily require direct in line flow
are those with rest pain ``for which correction of inflow disease alone
or treatment of FP disease even without continuous tibial runoff to the
foot may provide relief of symptoms. This may also be the case in
patients presenting with minor degrees of tissue loss.''

Profunda-popliteal collateral index (Segmental pressures AK-BK/AK) of
less than 0.25 may suggest that there is sufficient collateral network
between profunda and popliteal that SFA treatment may not be necessary.
(Boren et al. 1980; Mawatari et al. 2000)

\textbf{What are some essential Key Factors to consider before deciding
Open versus Endovascular according to the CLTI guidelines?}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{The ``availability of and quality of autogenous vein
  conduit''}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Single segment GSV best conduit for infrageniculate bypass. (Arvela
    et al. 2010; Avgerinos et al. 2015; Moreira et al. 2016).
  \item
    Fem-AK pop bypass with prosthetic may be preferred to contralateral
    GSV. (Moreira et al. 2016)
  \item
    If the target is below the knee, then all autogenous
    conduits--contralateral GSV, SSV, and spliced arm vein--are
    preferred over prosthetic grafts.(Brochado Neto et al. 2014; Faries
    et al. 2000; Taylor et al. 1987)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Patient overall risk (as mentioned above) and Limb Staging}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Planning distal bypasses should take into account the angiosome of
    the wound and the most distal healthy inflow vessel to result in the
    shortest bypass possible.(Hingorani et al. 2016; Jongsma et al.
    2017)
  \item
    Intensified anti-thrombotic therapy may be needed in patients with
    ``high risk'' infrainguinal bypasses--prosthetic conduit, below the
    knee target, suboptimal conduit, poor arterial runoff, extensive
    lesions or tissue loss. Single anti-platelet may not be sufficient,
    and should be intensified to asa/rivaroxaban, dual antiplatelet, or
    anticoagulation with Vit K antagonist.(Conte, Pomposelli, Clair,
    Geraghty, McKinsey, Mills, Moneta, Murad, Powell, Reed, and al.
    2015; Hussain et al. 2018; Strobl et al. 2013; Tepe et al. 2012)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{The Target EndoVascular Intervention (TVI) outcomes}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{What evidence do we have for deciding between Endo and Open
management? What is the BASIL trial?}

In November of 2022, the first results of the \textbf{BEST-CLI} were
published in the NEJM. BEST-CLI is the first international, open-label,
multicenter, superiority trial of its scope and scale. The key results
found that in patients with adequate great saphenous vein conduit, the
surgical group demonstrated a lower incidence of major adverse limb
events or death (the study's primary endpoint) than the endovascular
group. They found relatively equivalent outcomes in patients with
inadequate autogenous conduit.(Farber et al. 2022) The full impact of
the results of this study is yet to be determined, and there will likely
be several additional analyses published from this study's data. It is
unlikely that this data will impact what is tested on this year's exams.
However, you should keep an eye out for future results!

\end{tcolorbox}

Other than this most recent study, the evidence is largely of poor
quality, and is retrospective, non-controlled, or industry sponsored.
\textbf{BASIL} (Bypass versus Angioplasty in Severe Ischemia of the Leg)
previously had been the only multicenter RCT (BASIL -2 and 3 underway)
directly comparing an endo versus open management strategy for CLTI and
Infra-inguinal occlusive disease.~

BASIL compared POBA and Bypass across multiple centers (27 centers,
n=452, 1999-2004) in the UK. Primary endpoint was Amputation-Free
Survival (AFS). (Bradbury et al. 2005)

Major Findings:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  At 6-months follow up: no difference in AFS.
\item
  Intention-To-Treat Analysis of overall follow up showed no significant
  difference in AFS and overall survival.
\item
  Among patients who survived \textgreater2 years, overall survival was
  better for those treated with Bypass as a first approach
\item
  Analysis to treat:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Prosthetic Bypass Patients did very poorly (even compared to POBA).
  \item
    Patients who had bypass after failed POBA had significantly worse
    AFS compared to those treated with a bypass as initial treatment.
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

Criticism of BASIL:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Majority had POBA alone (not currently best endovascular option)
\item
  25 \% of Open Bypass were Prosthetic
\item
  The technology and technical Skill with growing operator experience in
  Endovascular has improved.
\end{enumerate}

For isolated tibial disease, first line endovascular treatment of choice
is transluminal, or subintimal angioplasty. Atherectomy, stenting, and
drug coated balloons are often used, but should currently not be
considered first line, but this data is rapidly evolving. Patency is
often poor but limb salvage is reasonable.(Popplewell and Bradbury 2019;
Kayssi et al. 2016; Mustapha et al. 2016)

Optimal follow up for endovascular interventions of the lower extremity
has not yet been established, but should at least include a pulse exam,
ABPI and duplex to establish a new baseline after intervention.(Zierler
et al. 2018; Mohler et al. 2012)

\textbf{What are the BASIL 2, BASIL 3, and BEST-CLI Trials?}

\textbf{BASIL 2:} Infrapopliteal Disease: Vein Bypass First vs.~Best
Endovascular Treatment first.

\textbf{BASIL 3:} PBA +/- BMS vs.~DCB +/- BMS vs.~DES

(Both Follow up 24-60 months, Primary Endpoint AFS)

\textbf{BEST-CLI:} Open Bypass versus Endovascular Intervention, Primary
Endpoint: MALE-Free Survival. Major Above-the-Ankle Amputation, Major
Bypass or Jump/interposition graft revision or the need for thrombectomy
or thrombolysis (MALE).

\textbf{What are some complications of lower extremity revascularization
procedures?}

For a comprehensive list of access complications after endovascular
therapy, see Section~\ref{sec-access-comp}

Femoral exploration carries high risk of infection or lymphatic leak.
Lymphatic leaks often resolve spontaneously. Infected lymphatic leaks,
particularly in the setting of prosthetic bypass require exploration.
Should a lymph leak not resolve with conservative management, definitive
therapy requires alcohol ablation or muscle flap coverage. The most
important aspect of lymph leak is prevention with careful dissection and
tissue management during femoral exploration.(A. Obara et al. 2014; M.
V. Weaver et al. 2014)

\textbf{What is Acute Limb Ischemia and what does it encompass?}

Acute Limb Ischemia (ALI) is defined as any process that leads to an
abrupt cessation of blood flow to a limb resulting in ischemia. There
are several causes, but the most common two are embolic and thrombotic.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Embolism}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \textbf{\emph{Cardiac}}

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Typically due to atrial fibrillation.
    \item
      Acute upper limb ischemia is most commonly due to cardiac
      embolism.~
    \item
      Endocarditis -- as seen in IV drug users or patients with
      bacteremia from other causes.
    \item
      Cardiac tumors -- such as atrial myxoma.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    \textbf{\emph{Atherosclerosis}} -- e.g.~iliac disease embolizing
    downstream to the lower leg.
  \item
    \textbf{\emph{Paradoxical Embolism}} -- Thromboembolic venous system
    with PFO.~
  \item
    \textbf{\emph{Aneurysm}} -- e.g.~thrombus from within an aortic
    aneurysm embolizing downstream to the leg.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Thrombosis}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \textbf{\emph{Aneurysm -}} Small aneurysms (such as popliteal) are
    less likely to rupture, but more likely to thrombose or embolize
    distally, causing an acute limb ischemic event.
  \item
    \textbf{\emph{Acute on Chronic Progression of Atherosclerosis -}}
    Acute on Chronic Progression of Atherosclerosis: Once a chronic
    stenosis becomes critically tight, platelet thrombus can develop
    leading to an acute occlusion; or unstable plaque can ``rupture''
    leading to an acute occlusion of a chronic lesion.
  \item
    \textbf{\emph{Bypass Graft}}
  \item
    \textbf{\emph{Dissection}} - for more, see
    Chapter~\ref{sec-aortic-dissection}
  \item
    \textbf{\emph{Thoracic Outlet Syndrome}} in the upper extremity -
    fore more, see Section~\ref{sec-atos}
  \item
    \textbf{\emph{Vasospasm}} (severe) - for more, see
    Section~\ref{sec-vasospastic-disorders}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{presentation-12}{%
\subsubsection{Presentation}\label{presentation-12}}

\textbf{What is the patient presentation of ALI? Are there any
differences between upper and lower extremity presentations?}

Classically remembered by the 5 or 6 Ps (depending on who you ask)

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{\emph{Pain}}: Usually located distal to the occlusion and
  gradually increases in severity as the ischemic time increases until
  neuroischemic sensory loss occurs.
\item
  \textbf{\emph{Pallor}}: the limb appears pale compared to the non
  ischemic limb. There is delayed or absent capillary refill.
\item
  \textbf{\emph{Poikiolothermia}}: (just a way to make ``cold'' into a
  ``P'' -- really means cold limb) Literally the inability to regulate
  one's body temperature, or dependent on ambient temperature as cold
  blooded animals are. If there is no limb perfusion, it acclimates to
  the ambient temperature and feels cold to the touch.~
\item
  \textbf{\emph{Pulseless}}: Self explanatory. It is worth examining the
  contralateral limb, if it has normal pulses, it suggests the absence
  of PAOD or CLTI making thrombosis in situ less likely to be the cause
  of ALI.~
\item
  \textbf{\emph{Paresthesia and Paralysis}} are the last two Ps.
  Paresthesia is an earlier sign of ischemic nerve dysfunction, and
  paralysis is a later sign. In the lower leg, ischemic changes often
  affects the anterior compartment first, and sensory loss over the
  dorsum of the foot is, therefore, one of the earlier neurologic
  deficits in ALI.
\end{itemize}

This is why a thorough physical exam is key; comparing both limbs and
including handheld doppler exam. It can be difficult to tell whether a
limb is acutely threatened, especially in patients with chronic disease
where the presentation of an acute change can be more subtle. This is
why it is also essential to assess sensory and motor function in
addition to the pulse exam. This helps gauge the urgency of
intervention.

Acute paralysis, mottling of bilateral lower extremities and absent
femoral pulses should raise concern for aortic occlusion.(J. C. Wang,
Kim, and Kashyap 2016)

\textbf{How is ALI classified?}

From Rutherford RB, Baker JD, Ernst C, et \,al.~Recommended standards
for reports dealing with lower extremity ischemia: revised version. J
Vasc Surg. 1997;26:517--538. (Rutherford et al. 1997)

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Viable - Not immediately threatened

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Sensory Loss: None; Motor Weakness: None
  \item
    Arterial Signal: Present; Venous Signal; Present
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Threatened

  a. Marginally - Salvageable if promptly treated (\textless24hrs)

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Sensory Loss: Minimal (toes) or none; Motor Weakness: None
  \item
    Arterial Signal: Weak/absent; Venous Signal: Present
  \end{itemize}

  b. Immediately - Salvageable if immediately treated (\textless6hrs)

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Sensory Loss: More than toes; Motor Weakness: Mild/Moderate
  \item
    Arterial Signal: Absent; Venous Signal: Absent
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Irreversible - Major tissue loss or permanent nerve damage inevitable;
  Minimal benefit from revasc

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Sensory Loss: Profound anesthesia; Motor Weakness: Dense paralysis
    (rigor)
  \item
    Arterial Signal: Absent; Venous Signal: Absent
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{evaluation-19}{%
\subsection{Evaluation}\label{evaluation-19}}

\textbf{What does the work up for ALI entail? How is the diagnosis
made?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The diagnosis can often be made on history, physical exam, and
  bilateral ABPIs. Imaging can be done in patients in who the diagnosis
  is uncertain.
\item
  As with most urgent cases, the type of imaging done depends on the
  availability at your institution, but generally CT angiography or
  arteriography should be done on viable and marginally threatened
  limbs. Arteriography often can distinguish between embolic vs arterial
  thrombosis which may help to direct management.
\item
  Bedside ultrasound can also be very helpful, especially color flow
  doppler US.
\end{itemize}

The decision to perform cross-sectional imaging before angiography
varies depending on how severe the presentation is and how quickly you
can obtain imaging. The patient's renal function may also influence the
decision to administer two contrast loads (CT followed by endovascular
intervention). If a femoral pulse is present it could be feasible to
proceed with on-table angiogram without a CT scan. If femoral pulses are
absent there is increased suspicion of aortoiliac disease and therefore
CT angiogram will be beneficial for both diagnosis and operative
planning.

In patients with severe renal insufficiency, MRA or MR time-of-flight
can be helpful, but these studies usually take longer to obtain and may
not be quickly available in an acute threatened limb situation.
Therefore going straight to angiography should be considered, as to get
the most immediate and best imaging of the tibial vessels. (Creager,
Kaufman, and Conte 2012; Earnshaw 2019)

\hypertarget{management-33}{%
\subsection{Management}\label{management-33}}

\textbf{What is normally done in the initial management of ALI?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{\emph{Anticoagulation}}: IV unfractionated heparin should be
  immediately administered to prevent proximal and distal progression of
  secondary thrombus as long as heparin is not contraindicated. The dose
  should be titrated to maintain activated partial thromboplastin time
  between 50 and 80 seconds (2-3 times normal values). A good rule of
  thumb for IV heparin is to start with a bolus of 80-100 units/kg, and
  then drop at 18units/kg/hr -- titrating to PTT at 2-3x normal -- or
  follow local protocol.
\item
  \textbf{\emph{Supportive Care}}: Analgesia, iv fluids.
\item
  \textbf{\emph{Labs}}: A full panel including serum chemistry with BUN,
  Cr, CBC, and coagulation studies should be obtained. Baseline plasma
  CPK can be helpful to monitor for evidence of rhabdomyolysis after
  reperfusion.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Patients with acute limb ischemia, neuro deficit and distal pop

  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{\emph{Bypass}}

  \begin{itemize}

  \item
    Patients with aortic occlusion, multiple life limiting
    comorbidities, and significant aortoiliac baseline disease may
    benefit from primary axillo-bifemoral bypass. (Mohapatra et al.

  vessel disease burden.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{endovascular-management}{%
\subsubsection{Endovascular Management}\label{endovascular-management}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{\emph{Pharmacological Catheter Directed Thrombolysis}}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Absolute contraindications include active bleeding disorder, CVA
    (\textless6mo), CNS injury or head injury (\textless3mo), or GI
    bleed (\textless10d).
  \item
    Relative contraindications include recent major surgery,
    uncontrolled hypertension, intracranial tumor, pregnancy, recent eye
    surgery, hepatic failure, CPR (\textless10d), or bacterial
    endocarditis.
  \item
    1-2\% risk of hemorrhagic stroke. If neurologic deficit develops
    during thrombolysis, stop lysis and perform immediate CT head.
    (Kenneth Ouriel, Veith, and Sasahara 1998)
  \item
    If fibrinogen drops below 100mg/dl, recommend immediate cessation of
    lytic agent and consider cyroprecipitate (includes fibrinogen,
    factor VIII, von Willebrand's factor, factor XIII).(Mann 2019)
  \item
    Pharmacological thrombolysis may be delivered over a short duration
    in the operation room, or a catheter may be left and tPA
    administered over a longer period. Two catheters for delivery
    include an Cragg-McNamara catheter with multiple side holes or an
    EKOS catheter that uses ultrasonic waves to aid with thrombus lysis.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{\emph{Percutaneous Thrombus Aspiration}}: Useful for small
  fresh thrombi such as after angioplasty, as distal diameter of the
  catheter tip limits the size of the thrombus that can be removed.~
\item
  \textbf{\emph{Mechanical Thrombolysis and Aspiration}}: Are also
  useful for patients with contraindications for thrombolytic therapy,
  and also may allow for a lower dose of a thrombolytic agent, but risk
  damage to the arterial wall.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{relevant-literature}{%
\subsubsection{Relevant Literature}\label{relevant-literature}}

\textbf{\emph{STILE Trial}}: One of the first large RCTs comparing
catheter thrombolysis with open surgery.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Overall the study showed some short term benefit to open surgery
  however this can probably be attributed to:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
  \item
    In 28\% of patients randomized to CDT they weren't able to get a
    catheter in place so these patients were considered treatment
    failures and crossed over to the surgery arm.
  \item
    Patients with very long duration of ischemia, up to 6 months, were
    also included in the study.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  When outcomes for patients who had been symptomatic for less than 2
  weeks were analysed, the thrombolysis patients actually did better.
  (T. S. Investigators 1994)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{\emph{TOPAS Trial}}: Larger RCT which enrolled patients who had
an acute arterial occlusion of less than 14 days. This showed no
difference in mortality or amputation-free survival between the open
surgery and CDT groups but higher major bleeding in the CDT group.
(Kenneth Ouriel, Veith, and Sasahara 1998)

\textbf{\emph{Meta Analysis}}: Originally published in 2002 but updated
in 2013 and 2018. Demonstrated no difference in mortality or limb
salvage between surgical and thrombolytic therapy, but endovascular
demonstrated higher rates of complications including ongoing limb
ischemia and bleeding within 30 days of treatment. Previously they had
reported higher rates of stroke in the thrombolysis category but the
most recent update is unable to support this finding. (Darwood et al.
2018)

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Evidence considered, it is very reasonable to think about a
  catheter-directed therapy especially if the presentation is acute,
  less than 2 weeks or so. There are, however, certain anatomical
  locations, such as common femoral or brachial arteries, that most
  surgeons would favor a simple open procedure (i.e.~balloon
  thrombectomy).
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{decision-making}{%
\subsubsection{Decision Making}\label{decision-making}}

\textbf{Who gets which kinds of treatment? Who needs emergent
treatment?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Class I} patients might just need medical therapy like
  anticoagulation and revascularization can be elective.~
\item
  \textbf{Class IIb} patients do not need immediate revascularization

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    If symptoms have been present for less than 2 weeks endovascular
    therapy is preferred
  \item
    If more than 2 weeks or lytic therapy has failed then surgical
    intervention is preferred
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Class IIb} need immediate revascularization. Historically
  surgical revascularization has been preferred because of its
  immediacy, but catheter directed thrombolysis and percutaneous
  mechanical thrombectomy have shortened time to revascularization.
\item
  \textbf{Class III} ALI is usually treated with primary amputation
  because revascularization is unlikely to restore function to the limb
  and restoring blood flow can cause the patient serious harm.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \textbf{What are the risks of revascularization for a class III or
    prolonged ischemia?} Myonephropathic metabolic syndrome: muscle
    cells undergo liquefaction necrosis due to ischemia. Potassium,
    myoglobin, lactic acid, and superoxide accumulate and can perfuse
    through the body or can have a sudden increase in the event of
    revascularization which leads to hyperkalemia, arrhythmias,
    pulmonary edema, metabolic acidosis, myoglobinuria, and can even
    cause sudden death from heart and/or renal failure. (H. Obara,
    Matsubara, and Kitagawa 2018) Treatment of this is largely
    supportive with fluids.

\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{compartment-syndrome}{%
\section{Compartment Syndrome}\label{compartment-syndrome}}

\hypertarget{etiology-8}{%
\subsection{Etiology}\label{etiology-8}}

\textbf{What is the pathophysiology and presentation of compartment
syndrome?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Increased intramuscular compartment pressure results from increases in
  capillary permeability due to ischemic reperfusion. The increase in
  pressure leads to neuromuscular dysfunction and interferes with
  circulation. Irreversible damage occurs when pressures exceed 30mmHg
  in each compartment.~~
\item
  Ischemia reperfusion causes increased capillary permeability due to
  free oxygen radicals, neutrophils and endothelial factors that collect
  during ischemia. Severity depends on time to reperfusion, muscle mass,
  and flow pattern (i.e.~direct or collateral). Symptoms often develop
  within 6 hours of reperfusion. (Keudell et al. 2015)
\item
  The pathophysiology underlying acute extremity compartment syndrome is
  related to the arteriovenous pressure gradient theory. Increased
  compartment pressure reduces the gradient, reducing arterial pressure
  and increasing venous pressure.(Frink et al. 2010; McQueen and
  Court-Brown 1996; Elliott and Johnstone 2003; Papalambros et al. 1989)
\item
  Clinically patients can have neurological dysfunction with sensory
  motor deficits, but the most common presentation is a tense extremity
  with severe pain on passive movement of the muscles in the
  compartment. If the lower leg is affected this is often on
  dorsiflexion/plantar flexion of the ankle. A sensitive indicator is
  loss of two point discrimination (proprioception).
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{evaluation-20}{%
\subsection{Evaluation}\label{evaluation-20}}

\textbf{How do you diagnose compartment syndrome?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Physical Exam}: Tenderness, (especially over anterior
  compartment) and paresthesias (especially between first and second
  toes).

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \textbf{\emph{Anterior Compartment}}: Sensory distribution and
    muscular innervation from the deep peroneal nerve (this is a VSITE
    favorite).
  \item
    \textbf{\emph{Deep Posterior Compartment}}: Sensory distribution and
    muscular innervation from the tibial nerve(Velmahos and Toutouzas
    2002).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Compartment Pressures}:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    A needle is required to access the compartment and a pressure
    monitoring system (this can be handheld Stryker kit, or just a
    hollow bore needle connected to an arterial pressure bag).
  \item
    \textbf{\emph{Normal compartment pressure is \textless10-20mmHg}};
    greater than 30 is highly concerning.~ More accurate than an
    absolute number is comparing the compartment pressure to the mean
    arterial pressure or diastolic pressure.~ If the compartment
    pressure is within 40mmHg of the MAP (for example, MAP is 60 and
    compartment pressure is 25 -- this is concerning) -- OR -- if the
    difference between compartment pressure and diastolic pressure is
    less than 10 (for example, diastolic pressure is low at 30, and
    compartment pressure is 22).
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

If the clinical suspicion of compartment syndrome is high, do not be
reassured by ``normal'' compartment pressures. It is relatively low risk
to do fasciotomies, but the risk of limb loss is high for a missed
compartment syndrome.

\hypertarget{management-34}{%
\subsection{Management}\label{management-34}}

\textbf{Management of compartment syndrome is a fasciotomy, what are the
types of fasciotomies?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Forearm and Upper Arm Fasciotomies}: Often performed by
  orthopedic or hand surgeons. The forearm fasciotomy includes dorsal
  and volar incisions to release the dorsal and volar compartment, and
  mobile wad, while avoiding numerous superficial cutaneous nerves. The
  arm fasciotomy releases the medial, lateral, and deltoid compartments
  through medial lateral incisions.
\item
  \textbf{Thigh}: Performed through medial and lateral incisions to
  release the lateral, medial and posterior compartment.
\item
  \textbf{Lower Leg}: The most common type is a lower leg 4 compartment
  fasciotomy and is explained in more detail below. ~
\end{itemize}

\textbf{How is a lower leg 4 compartment fasciotomy for the lower
extremity performed?}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  A longitudinal incision is created between the fibular shaft and the
  crest of the tibia over the intermuscular septum and the anterior and
  lateral compartments are opened. If tissues are swollen occluding the
  view of the intermuscular septum, the perforating vessels can be
  followed down to it. Nerves including the peroneal nerve are most at
  risk near the fibular head.
\item
  A second incision is created on the medial surface of the lower leg
  approx. 1cm posterior to the edge of the tibia to avoid the greater
  saphenous vein. The superficial posterior compartment is incised. The
  gastrocnemius-soleus complex is taken down from its attachments to the
  tibia in order to access the deep posterior compartment.~
\item
  The incisions should be made generously. Sometimes the skin incision
  can be a little short of the fascial incision, but they should be long
  in order to fully release the compartments.
\item
  After hemostasis loose dressings should be applied. The leg should be
  elevated to reduce edema that can complicate closure. Closure can be
  done in 48-72 hours, but may be delayed and dressed with wound vacs to
  attempt primary closure. If primary closure is not possible, a split
  thickness skin graft can be used.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Who should a prophylactic fasciotomy be performed on?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Patients with high occlusion and extensive ischemia.
\item
  Acute ischemia of greater than 6 hours with few collaterals.
\item
  Patients with combined arterial and venous injury.
\item
  Patients who are obtunded making serial examination difficult.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What is the prognosis for a patient with ALI? What are some
patient factors that lead to a poor prognosis?}

Amputation rates after acute limb ischemia are typically described in
the 10-20\% range, and mortality is also in the 10-25\% range whether
you're talking about surgery or catheter-directed procedures (that's
excluding the patients who present with Rutherford class III and by
definition have an unsalvageable limb). Many factors determine
likelihood of amputation; typically, patients with more medical comorbid
conditions tend to do worse as you might expect: baseline CAD, kidney
disease and smoking are predictive of worse outcomes. There is a trend
toward improved limb salvage rates (decreased amputation rate) over
time, and I think this speaks to wider availability of different limb
salvage techniques among vascular surgeons across the globe.

Blue toe syndrome is characterized as a painful discolored toe in the
setting of a normal vascular examination or palpable pulses.

Acute onset of blue toe after MI - consider cholesterol embolization
from wire manipulation in the aorta. (Saric and Kronzon 2012)

\hypertarget{evaluation-21}{%
\subsection{Evaluation}\label{evaluation-21}}

Patients should have a work up for investigation of an embolic source.
Patients without a clear recent source of embolization on history or
physical examination, should undergo:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  CTA of chest/abdomen/pelvis to look for an arterial lesion.
\item
  Echocardiogram to identify a cardiac source.
\item
  Holter monitor to evaluate for an underlying arrhythmias.
\end{itemize}

If no obvious source of embolism can be identified, further
investigation for underlying cancer may be required due to malignancy
leading to prothombotic state.

\textbf{Specific Thrombogenic Arterial Lesion}: Medical management with
anticoagulation. Recurrent symptoms on anticoagulation may require stent

Compression can sometimes be relieved by percutaneous drainage of large
cystic portion that is causing luminal compression. PTA and stenting
should be avoided as often poor durability. Operative resection and
reconstruction with an interposition graft can be effective but should
be considered as a final management strategy.(S. Li et al. 2017)

\hypertarget{amputations}{%
\section{Amputations}\label{amputations}}

The majority of questions regarding amputations stem from decision
making around peripheral arterial disease. You may not see many
questions asking uniquely about amputation technique or management,
however this topic is VERY important for the successful management of
peripheral arterial disease. Rutherford's has two fantastic chapters on
decision making(Bianchi and Jr 2018) and techniques(Eidt and Kalapatapu
2019).

The most commonly performed lower extremity amputations include:

\hypertarget{above-knee-trans-femoral-amputation-aka}{%
\subsection{Above-knee, trans-femoral amputation
(AKA)}\label{above-knee-trans-femoral-amputation-aka}}

Above the knee amputations are most often performed with a fish mouth
incision. Suture ligation of the neurovascular bundle at the level of
the mid SFA and transection of the femur.

\hypertarget{below-knee-trans-tibial-amputation-bka}{%
\subsection{Below-knee, trans-tibial amputation
(BKA)}\label{below-knee-trans-tibial-amputation-bka}}

Below the knee amputation often performed with a long posterior, or
Burgess, flap. Each tibial neuro vascular bundle is ligated
individually. The fibula is transected 2-3cm more proximally than the
tibia to avoid weight bearing from the prosthetic.

Although hotly debated, a Cochrane review demonstrated no difference in
outcomes based on flap type. However, the review does recommend
performing amputations in two stages in the setting of wet
gangrene.(Tisi and Than 2014)

\hypertarget{transmetatarsal-amputation-tma}{%
\subsection{Transmetatarsal amputation
(TMA)}\label{transmetatarsal-amputation-tma}}

Transmetatersal amputation is performed with transection of the
metatarsal bones just distal to the heads. Best to transect in a
graduated parabola with the 5th metatarsal most proximal. Patients may
benefit from concomitant Achilles tendon lengthening to prevent equinous
deformity that can result in ulceration of the medial aspect of the
TMA.(Eidt and Kalapatapu 2019)

\hypertarget{terminology-and-presentation}{%
\subsection{Terminology and
Presentation}\label{terminology-and-presentation}}

\textbf{What is chronic venous insufficiency and how common is it?}

I thought the first question was going to be nice, easy and
uncontroversial, but you've started with CVI. What you've highlighted is
one of the main problems with venous disease, which is terminology. So
if you type in chronic venous insufficiency into Google, you end up
with, this enormous range of descriptions and how its used in lots of
different ways, by lots of different people.

One of the problems is that this led to a lot of confusion among people
within the venous space and everywhere else. A really important
documents to guide people is the VEIN-TERM consensus document published
in 2009.(Eklof et al. 2009) The lead author was Dr.~Bo Eklof and this
was a document where a group of venous experts around the world got
together and said, okay, we need to be clear and define what all these
different terms mean.

And one of the terms that was described was chronic venous
insufficiency. The official definition is it is a venous disease between
C3 and C6 on the CEAP classification. We'll talk about that a bit later,
I'm sure. But between C3 and C6. In practice, it is used to describe the
entire spectrum of venous disease ranging from thread veins C1 all the
way up to venous ulceration. But technically it is C3 to C6. And I would
urge anybody who is learning about the terminology to look at the vein
term documents.(Eklöf et al. 2004; Eklof et al. 2009)

And silly little things like great saphenous vein and small saphenous
vein--I think UK is the only place where long saphenous is ever used and
the real problem was LSV in lots of other countries will be the lesser
saphenous vein, which is the small saphenous vein. So again, I'd urge
anyone to look at that document.

\textbf{How common is chronic venous insufficiency?}

Chronic venous disease is very common, with the weather getting a bit
nicer, people wearing shorts, you're spotting, venous disease all over
the place. The studies that have been done indicate that at least a
quarter, probably up to a third of people have C2 to C6 disease. So a
very common problem, with lots of people that need treatment.

The Edinburgh Vein Study found that half of the general population with
chronic venous disease deteriorated over the 13 year study. Factors
associated with disease progression included family/personal history of
DVT. Of note, female gender, obesity, number of pregnancies, and smoking
status were not associated with progression.(C.-C. Lee et al. 2015)

\textbf{Now we would like to discuss the classification and scoring
systems, you mentioned CAEP, could you expand on that?}

So CEAP-\/-clinical, etiological (with an E because it's American),
anatomical, pathophysiological--classification system was introduced, I
think in the mid 1990s, by the American Venous Forum. And it's a
classification system.

So if you have a patient that comes into your clinic with a venous
problem, it's a system to allow you to describe that patient's current
status in an objective, clear way. What it does not do is give you any
information about prognostication and it isn't useful for measuring
responses to treatment.

So it is purely a descriptive classification system. And the most
commonly used part is the clinical bit, which is C1 to C6. CEAP was just
recently revised last year, a 25 year revision, which again, I would
urge trainees to have a look at, Dr.~Fedor Lurie was the lead author,
and th is was a useful revision of CEAP.(Lurie et al. 2020)

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{images/ceap.jpeg}

}

\end{figure}

Now in response to the limitations of CEAP, the Venous Clinical Severity
Score (VCSS) was created. So this is a 10 item scoring system, each item
scores between zero and three. So you get a maximum score of 30. Now
this is designed to be responsive to treatment and complimentary to
CEAP.(Vasquez et al. 2010)

There are lots of other things that have been described, quality of life
tools or VDS, but I would say that those two (CEAP and VCSS) are the
most relevant and important ones to know about. Many of the QOL tools
are too cumbersome to use in day to day practice. We are in dire need of
a easy to use clinical tool that is validated for assessment of patient
reported outcomes. And again, the number of papers I've reviewed where
people have reported CEAP scores as one of the outcome measures in
response to treatments. That is not what it's designed for, for example,
you can never get lower than C5. You can never get better than a healed
ulcer. So again, that's the important distinction.

\hypertarget{evaluation-24}{%
\subsection{Evaluation}\label{evaluation-24}}

\textbf{When we do see patients in clinic with chronic venous
insufficiency, which type of imaging modalities should we use to
investigate the function and the anatomy of the lower limbs?}

If a patient comes to clinic, we can't underestimate the importance of
the clinical assessment. And when you assess these patients, you are
really looking for the impact of their venous disease on their quality
of life and the impact of the venous disease has on their normal
function.

But also you're looking for complications of venous disease. This is a
clinical assessment. But then when ordering investigations, you really
want to identify underlying treatable causes of their venous disease.
And that's the goal of any investigation.

Venous duplex imaging is obviously the first line, gold standard that
pretty much anybody will go to around the world. And what that does is
essentially gives you information about the venous flow, antegrade or
retrograde or refluxing flow in superficial and deep veins.

It'll give you information about the anatomy of the veins , which will
help you to plan treatment, but it also gives you lots of other
information as well. It gives you information in the common femoral
vein, for example, if there's good phasicity of flow or if there's any
scarring. It helps you to evaluate whether there might be some outflow
obstruction, so duplex imaging is the absolute first line, gold
standard. For more on venous duplex scanning, see
Section~\ref{sec-venous}.

Now, once you've done the duplex imaging, if there's clinical suspicion,
then of course we can move on to other investigations. So proximal CTV,
MRV, venography, IVUS. But clinical assessments and duplex assessment
are the bedrock of every assessment of every venous patient. So that's
the foundation.

\hypertarget{management-38}{%
\subsection{Management}\label{management-38}}

\textbf{Moving on to the treatment of superficial disease. When we talk
about treatment of superficial venous incompetence, I don't think we can
really get away from talking about the two major studies, the
ESCHAR}(Manjit S. Gohel et al. 2007) \textbf{and the EVRA}(Manjit S.
Gohel et al. 2018) \textbf{studies, which I know you've been involved
with. Can you review what these studies showed and their importance in
the care of our patients.}

Before I go into the trials, I'm just going to go back a step and just
talk about the general mindset that's important for these patients. So
what we're treating with these patients is not superficial venous
reflux. What we're treating is chronic venous hypertension. So we're
treating a pathophysiological entity of which the superficial reflux is
one correctable factor. And the reason that's important is that there
may be other correctable factors, such as venous outflow obstruction,
which may be addressed. Decision making also takes into account patient
presentation. For example a patient with asymptomatic varicose veins,
even with proximal obstruction and superficial reflux, should still only
be treated with compression.(Boezem et al. 2011; Wittens et al. 2015)

But there are also going to be lots of uncorrectable factors, such as
poor mobility, heart failure, dependency, ankle stiffness. If your ankle
is stiff, you can't use your calf muscle to pump effectively. You don't
have that mechanism for reducing the venous pressure in your legs. So
the success of these treatments, particularly for the ulcer population,
has to be taken in the context of treating venous hypertension as well.

Having said that, the aim of these trials was really very simple. Most
patients with venous ulceration have superficial reflux. So what is the
role of treating the superficial reflux? That's the simple question that
was asked by these trials.

The ESCHAR trial recruited between 1999 and 2002, and included 500
patients with healed and open leg ulcers. They were either randomized to
compression or compression and traditional, superficial venous surgery
(stripping or ligation). And that trial was very clear. It showed that
with venous stripping there wasn't a benefit for healing, but there was
a significant and sizable reduction in the risk of ulcer
recurrence.(Manjit S. Gohel et al. 2007)

So one of the criticisms of ESCHAR was lots of people didn't have the
same surgery. Lots of people had just ligation alone, et cetera. We
don't really do stripping anymore, it's all endovenous. So EVRA really
aimed to bring the ESCHAR trial up to modern practice. We randomized 450
patients with open leg ulcers to early endovenous treatments, delivered
within two weeks versus a more delayed approach. What EVRA showed, again
is common sense, if you deal with the underlying problem (usually
superficial reflux), the venous ulceration healed significantly
quicker.(Manjit S. Gohel et al. 2018)

So putting them together, there is a clear, unequivocal argument for
treating the superficial reflux in these patients as quickly as
possible.

\hypertarget{endovenous}{%
\subsubsection{Endovenous}\label{endovenous}}

\textbf{Can you broadly outline the different treatment options that can
be offered to patients with superficial venous reflex?}

I have counted about 42 different ways of destroying a saphenous vein.
There are lots of different treatment options. Do something that you're
trained in and proficient with and something that's appropriate. Thermal
ablation is in the NICE guidance and in lots of other international
guideline documents has been combined, whether it's radiofrequency or
laser. Although foam sclerotherapy therapy, when studied in randomized
trials, has lower technical success rates and lower vein closure rates,
the clinical success rates in terms of healing are just as good. This
reduced effectiveness in closing the vein, doesn't really seem to
translate into a significant drop in clinical effectiveness after foam
sclerotherapy.

So I think the most important thing is not necessarily what you use,
it's doing it quickly and delivering it to the people that need it.
However, there are a few relative contraindications to GSV
ablation.(Atasoy 2015; Gloviczki et al. 2011; Lowell S. Kabnick and
Sadek 2019) These include:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  GSV \textgreater12mm width raises concern for incomplete obliteration
\item
  Superficial GSV unlikely to be pushed down with tumescence - could
  cause staining or thermal injury to the skin
\item
  GSV tortuosity may limit the ability to pass a catheter and
  sufficiently ablate the vein
\item
  Acute superficial vein thrombosis.
\end{itemize}

with Dr.~Andrew Meltzer} as he discusses some controversies in
variations in practice regarding the use of endovenous ablation
procedures in the United States.

\end{tcolorbox}

\textbf{When we are consenting patients for endovenous intervention,
what risks should we discuss with the patient and that they need to be
aware of?}

You can spend an hour doing this, if you're being very diligent. But
what I say to patients are that there are generic risks of venous
thromboembolism, as is the risk of any intervention. And I think that's
worthy of specific discussion after endovenous procedures, but I quote a
risk of around one in 200 for most endovenous interventions.
\textbf{\emph{Extension of proximal thrombus into the deep system is
termed endothermal heat-induced thrombosis (EHIT) and is evaluated and
treated aggressively in the United States.}}(Sadek et al. 2013; Lowell
S. Kabnick et al. 2021) EHIT is defined as:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}

\end{longtable}

There's always a risk of bruising. And if you do phlebectomies, what I
often tell people is that bruising sometimes looks worse than it feels.
And with the thermal interventions in particular, I think the risk of
nerve related complications, so some numbness or some nerve pain, are
worthy of mentioned, and of course the risk of recurrence. Recurrence of
varicose veins in the lateral thigh may be related to untreated anterior
accessory greater saphenous vein disease.(Laredo, Lee, and Neville 2010)

Foam sclerotherapy has a different mechanism of action. It's a detergent
that's injected into the vein that destroys the endothelium. And there
are some people that have associated foam sclerotherapy with some
neurological events. So a very large registry that was organized by the
manufacturers of STS recently looked at 10,000 patients in the UK and
found very few events-around one in 4-5,000.

There are a number of complications related to sclerotherapy that should
be understood. Hyperpigmentation is probably the most common
complication (11-80\%), but only a small percentage persist up to a year
(1-2\%). Incision and drainage of the thrombus 2-4 weeks after treatment
may reduce hyperpigmentation. New appearance of fine red telangiectasias
(AKA telangiectatic matting) is related to underlying vessel injury in
5-57\% of patients and can persist up to 1 year (1\%). Cutaneous
necrosis is rare (\textless1\%) and results from extravasation of
sclerosing agent, injection into dermal arteriole, reactive vasospasm or
excessive cutaneous pressure. DVT and cutaneous nerve injury are also
rare.(Bergan, Pascarella, and Mekenas 2006; Munavalli and Weiss 2007)

Some people say that if there is a history of migraine, then the risk of
these neurological events might be a little bit higher. So, a little bit
of caution, although in practice, I've treated many people with
migraines. But if you believe the literature, one in four or five,
people have got a little ASD and obviously we treated lots of those
people, so the risks are very low but it's just important to have that
discussion beforehand.

\textbf{Are there any techniques that we can use to mitigate some of
these risks?}

So I think VTE is something that is really worth specifically
discussing. It's a very rare event after superficial venous
interventions, but it's potentially catastrophic, with sometimes
national press coverage for bad outcomes. What we've got to realize is
that the rate of VTE events is very low, there are almost certainly some
people that have a higher risk. And so what we've got to get slightly
smarter about is identifying the people that have a higher risk of VTE
and maybe giving them prolonged course of thromboprophylaxis, as well as
appropriate counseling and mitigation as well.

So it's about getting smarter about risk assessment. The current risk
assessment tools are not really fit for purpose when it comes to
superficial venous intervention. So the department of health or the
Caprini tools don't really take into account some of the really
important factors that I think do impact on VTE risk after superficial
venous interventions.

There's nothing validated, there's nothing widely available, but we have
a local, specific risk assessment for patients having superficial venous
interventions. There are major risk factors we look out for, such as
previous ipsilateral VTE, active malignancy, but also significant
chronic inflammatory conditions (i.e.~inflammatory bowel disease), these
patients have a much higher risk of VTE than we previously recognized.
There are also minor factors, superficial vein thrombosis, obesity,
comorbidities. All of these things are put together and we come out with
a score. For patients above a certain threshold, they get offered
extended rivaroxaban or low molecular weight heparin.

In addition, it is important to implement mitigation. So traditionally
things like a contraceptive pill, HRT and Tamoxifen, we wouldn't usually
stop them for a local anesthetic procedure, but being on an estrogen
containing pill doubles or triples your risk of VTE. It's an easily
reversible thing in the short term that can be done. So for my patients,
I would normally recommend that we stop the pill or HRT a full month
before and after the procedure.

For preventing EHIT specifically, the radiofrequency ablation (RFA)
catheter should be placed 2cm from the SFJ. EHIT is a primarily
technical complication.(Joh et al. 2014)

\textbf{You mentioned it an extended course of anticoagulation for those
patients with risk factors. Is there a specific timescale locally that
you use for this?}

The venous forum produced some guidance the year before last in exactly
this area. We often only do about a week or 10 days for a lot of these
patients. However, if there's an ongoing, persistent risk factor, then
actually the VTE risk persists for four to six weeks, and thus there may
be an argument for up to six weeks of therapy in particularly high risk
patients.

However, if they are really that high risk, you've really got to
question whether a superficial venous intervention is needed, balancing
the risks and the benefits. But since for some patients the high risk
period persists for at least another six weeks afterwards, be careful
not to stop prophylaxis too soon.

\textbf{Moving on to a more specific question about treatment, what is
the role for treating and incompetent perforator veins in these
patients?}

In general, the more advanced the venous disease, the more likely it is
that the disease is recurrent, the more likely there is to be deep
venous disease or posts thrombotic disease, and the more likely you are
to finding incompetent perforators. If you imagine these patients with
venous ulcer, it is very common to find perforators, and if you take a
sort of super aggressive role saying you've got to obliterate every
single bit of reflux you can find, then you'd be doing a couple of
perforators in every single patient, and that is the approach of a
number of centers around the world.

The pragmatic reality is, number one, if you ablate the superficial
reflux, we know that a lot of these perforators actually become
competent because we've got rid of the outflow or you've changed the
dynamics in some other way, and they've become competent. Number two,
even if they've stayed incompetent, the clinical benefit is still there
and is usually still pretty durable. \textbf{\emph{The clinical criteria
most often used to as an indication for treatment is \textgreater350ms
of deep to superficial reflux, diameter greater than 3.5mm (associated
with reflux in 90\% of patients)}}(Sandri et al. 1999) \emph{\textbf{and
near a healed or active ulcer}.}(O'Donnell et al. 2014; Min, Khilnani,
and Golia 2003; Rueda et al. 2013)

Now, of course, there may be some people that develop recurrent problems
and then there can be a more targeted approach to the perforator. The
ESCHAR and EVRA studies did not target perforators at all and the
outcomes in the EVRA study was the best healing rate of any published
prospective leg ulcer study. So, putting all that together, it's
difficult to make a case for aggressive treatment of perforators first
up. Having said that for some people with recurrent disease, it's not
uncommon to have a big mid thigh Huntarian perforator or Cocker's
perforator lower down on the medial calf. So, I do treat perforators,
but almost always it's in recurrent disease with recurrence or
deteriorating symptoms.

\hypertarget{open-surgery-1}{%
\subsubsection{Open Surgery}\label{open-surgery-1}}

\textbf{So we've discussed quite a bit about endovenous intervention. Is
there a role for open surgery in some patients?}

Open surgery remains the most commonly used superficial venous
intervention around the world, and there are still lots of centers in
the UK that primarily offer open surgery. Being balanced, it's a very
effective treatment if you do it well and if you use modern approaches,
such as tumescent anesthesia and ultrasound guidance, then actually some
of the traditional issues with open surgery, which are often technical
and complication related, don't really apply.

Having said that, all the randomized trials have shown the same thing
while the effectiveness may be as good in open surgery done well, the
recovery is much better after endovenous ablation. So it's difficult to
make the case for open surgery when you've got something that is so well
established and the complications just so low, and it's cheaper when you
look at their theater capacity, et cetera.

So, I think there has to be a move towards endovenous, but there are
lots of things stopping this. In Germany, for example, the reimbursement
is greatest for open surgery. So surprise, surprise, there are still
lots and lots of open varicose vein operations. For trainees, it is
important to recognize that if you want to change practice, the single
biggest driver for change is reimbursement. You can change whatever you
like. So, I've treated maybe three patients with open surgery in the
last five years. One was a GP, who I had treated the other leg with open
surgery a few years earlier, and she said, ``I want the same operation,
please.'' So I did struggle to argue with that. The other two were big
three, four, five centimeters saphenovarices in the groin. So specific
indications, but not really for most patients.

For deep venous reflux, surgical management follows a relatively complex
algorithm.(O'Donnell et al. 2014) Valve prolapse due to vein wall
dilation may be treated with external banding. Isolated valve prolapse
may be treated with external valvuloplasty, and in severe cases an
internal valvuloplasty. When no adequate valve exists, then valve
transplant from a distant source, such as the axilla, may be
necessary.(Kabbani et al. 2011) These are not commonly performed
procedures and should be referred to centers with significant
experience.

\hypertarget{medical-management-5}{%
\subsubsection{Medical Management}\label{medical-management-5}}

\textbf{So we've talked about endovenous and surgical treatment, but are
there any pharmacological therapies that can be used in patients with
chronic venous insufficiency?}

So we're pretty skeptical in the UK, when it comes to venoactive or
pharmacological treatments. If you go to Europe, they love them. They're
over the counter in a lot of pharmacies. The drug with probably the most
evidence is something called Daflon, micronized purified flavonoid
fraction.

So flavonoids are naturally occurring, venoactive compounds. There are a
whole variety of effects, only some of which we understand. But a lot of
studies have shown improvements in edema and heaviness. Daflon is
marketed by a French company and it's got good evidence, but they do not
see places like the UK as a big enough market because of our inherent
skepticism over these sort of things, to make it worth their while to go
through the marketing and the regulatory processes. So it's not
available. But patients that have gone to France and picked it up over
the counter and have said it works well. So there may be a roll for some
venoactive medications such as pentoxyphyllin ---there's some good
evidence that it accelerates healing of leg ulcers.

But I don't think we're very receptive in the UK in general, not in the
vascular surgery community to prescribe pharmacological or herbal type
remedies.

\textbf{\emph{Wound management in patients with venous insufficiency
however has many medical adjuncts.}}Topical agents include excimer
(cadexomer) iodine, silver sulfadiazine, silver-containing dressings,
growth factors or cell-based therapy.

\textbf{What are the healthcare costs associated with the lower
extremity venous disease?}

The educated guesstimates in the UK, NHS, is around 2 billion pounds a
year. The UK NHS budget is about a 120 billion. So, up to about 2\% of
the budget, and that's just C6 disease. We're not even going into all of
the other diseases, the associated cellulitis, but also not only the
healthcare costs, but the societal costs, the time off work, the other
things. And then of course the superficial vein thrombosis, VTE and
other associated diseases, it's a massive underestimate.

\hypertarget{other-complications-of-superficial-venous-disease}{%
\subsection{Other Complications of Superficial Venous
Disease}\label{other-complications-of-superficial-venous-disease}}

\hypertarget{sec-superficial-vein-thrombosis}{%
\subsubsection{Superficial Vein
Thrombosis}\label{sec-superficial-vein-thrombosis}}

\textbf{You mentioned superficial vein thrombosis, also known as
superficial thrombophlebitis. What is it and how do you manage it?}

I'm very pleased you used both terms because I'm going to take the
opportunity to encourage robustly the use of \textbf{superficial vein
thrombosis} rather than thrombophlebitis. The problem with
thrombophlebitis is it is too closely associated with an infectious
etiology, which can lead to useless courses of antibiotics. Of course,
there's no infection, it's a thrombus in a superficial vein.
Traditionally, it's just been seen as just a bit of a nuisance and let's
not worry about it, treat with analgesia and anti-inflammatories, and
you'll be fine.

It can be a really sinister pathology and associated with VTE. If you
think of how many thousands, millions of people that have varicose
veins. They don't all get clots in their varicose veins. They've all got
stasis to a certain extent but they don't get clots. So it's more than
just the flow dynamics going on here. These people likely have an
thrombogenic innate tendency that leads to this. That's shown out in the
studies, some really good work in some French studies, such as the POST
study. They identified patients who were scanned with superficial vein
thrombosis, and a quarter of them on their first duplex scan had a DVT.
A lot of these DVTs were remote to the superficial vein
thrombosis.(Decousus et al. 2010) So they're not all extending into the
deep vein---they were remote---confirming this idea that actually a
thrombogenic problem is going on here. A patient with superficial vein
thrombus and a previous history of DVT could suggest a subsequent risk
of VTE up to 20\%.

So in the latest ESVS guidelines, there is quite a lot of content about
SVT treatment with algorithms. I would urge people to have a look at
that, and it's important to risk stratify people. Limited disease can be
followed with ultrasound at 1-2 weeks, but the closer you are to the
junction, the higher VTE risk, and actually for anyone other than just a
bit of clot in a varicosity, anticoagulation is the treatment of choice
to reduce progression to VTE.(Kakkos et al. 2021; Di Nisio, Wichers, and
Middeldorp 2018; Scovell, Ergul, and Conrad 2018)

CALISTO is the largest RCT and used treatment with 2.5mg SC
Fondaparinux.(C. S. Group et al. 2010; Blondon et al. 2012) Rivaroxaban
did subsequently demonstrate non-inferiority.(Werth et al. 2016) So look
at the guidelines, it's very clear what we should be doing with these
people, evidence-based, Once the anticoagulation is done, they need to
be re-scanned and that residual incompetent, scarred thrombogenic,
saphenous vein needs to be ablated or excised, otherwise they'll recur.
So a real change in mindset and level of aggression.(Kakkos et al. 2021;
Di Nisio, Wichers, and Middeldorp 2018; Scovell, Ergul, and Conrad 2018)

Pregnant patients are often high risk for lower extremity venous
complications and pose difficult clinical challenges. Extensive
superficial vein thrombus in pregnant patients should be treated with
LMWH and paused at delivery.(Kupelian and Huda 2007; Litzendorf and
Satiani 2011) If symptoms persist 3-6mo after delivery, the further
workup for pelvic congestive syndrome may be required with a
transvaginal ultrasound or cross sectional imaging.(Labropoulos et al.
2017)

\hypertarget{bleeding}{%
\subsubsection{Bleeding}\label{bleeding}}

\textbf{What's your approach to managing patients with bleeding varicose
veins?}

Really important question. It is a vascular emergency. There are several
depressing reports of patients having died from bleeding from a
varicosity. These are often elderly patients who are frail, with limited
mobility , and therefore can't bend down to press on the bleeding
varicosity down by the ankle ulcer. There's some very grim photos in
various case reports and it's really sad. There's two or three photos
that I've seen where an elderly patient has not wanted to wake their
partner and so has gone and laid down in the bath with this bleeding
vein that they couldn't control and basically exsanguinated.

So, it's a vascular emergency and these patients should be seen and
assessed and their superficial venous disease should be dealt with as
soon as possible. We have an emergency clinic running and anyone with
bleeding veins have the same urgency as the CLI patients and they were
treated there and then.

In terms of the treatment, there's two aspects: you want to decompress
the venous hypertension by ablating the saphenous reflux, but for the
specific bleeding area, I think there's a real case for some local foam
sclerotherapy. You want to block off that vulnerable bleeding vein to
ensure that this doesn't happen again. But again, if anyone receives a
referral, these are people to see straight away.

\hypertarget{acute-deep-venous-thrombosis-dvt}{%
\section{Acute Deep Venous Thrombosis
(DVT)}\label{acute-deep-venous-thrombosis-dvt}}

\textbf{So let's move on to discuss deep venous thrombosis. You're
recently involved in the European society of vascular surgery, venous
thrombosis guidelines. In the most part, calf DVTs are managed by
medical teams or dedicated DVT services within the hospital. So in this
section, we'll be focusing mostly on proximal DVT.}

\hypertarget{demographics-19}{%
\subsection{Demographics}\label{demographics-19}}

\hypertarget{physiology}{%
\subsubsection{Physiology}\label{physiology}}

\textbf{In medical school, we've learned a lot about Virchow's triad and
the etiology of venous thrombosis. Does that simple concept still hold
true today?}

I think it does. There's a few caveats and a few nuances, but I think
the principle that the flow, the vessel wall, and the blood constituents
are the main factors that affect whether or not you get thrombosis in a
vein is still pretty solid. However, there is also a real change in
mindset about the whole idea of provoked and unprovoked DVT. Again, I
would urge people to look at some of the new areas that we've covered in
these guidelines.

\hypertarget{prevalence}{%
\subsubsection{Prevalence}\label{prevalence}}

Incidence of DVT increases with age by a factor of 1.9 per 10 years. Of
patients who develop DVT, 1\% will have phlegmasia and 10\% may develop
a pulmonary embolism.

For post-thrombotic syndrome, 17\% will develop at 1 year and 29\% by 8
years after the initial DVT. For recurrence, 30\% will develop over 10
years but the highest risk for recurrence is in the first year.(Beckman
et al. 2010; C. M. Bulger, Jacobs, and Patel 2004; Meissner et al. 2007)

\hypertarget{etiology-9}{%
\subsubsection{Etiology}\label{etiology-9}}

\textbf{You mentioned there about potential risk factors for DVT, and
that can be classified into these provoked, which can be transient or
persistent, and then unprovoked risk factors. Can you talk about some of
the specific factors and causes?}

In general, what's been happening for several years is a recognition
that there are some DVTs that happened with a clear provoking factor---a
common major, transient, provoking factor is major surgery, for example.
So a lot of DVT are caused with that clear provoking factor, but there's
an enormous population of people that don't have a clear provoking
factor at all, or have a minor factor that may or may not have
contributed.

So traditionally there's been a dichotomy between provoked and
unprovoked. If it's provoked, they get a limited period of
anticoagulation is unprovoked it's long-term anticoagulation. And
certainly the last big thrombosis guidelines was the ACCP guidelines,
the American CHEST guidelines, and that's what they suggested, but it's
much more nuanced than that.

What we've got to remember is that there are some provoked DVTs where
there's much higher risk, and those are there's some unprovoked DVTs,
which actually there may be other factors that you need to take into
account. So I think for those people that are interested in this area,
it's really important to get to the nitty-gritty. So, long-winded way of
answering your question. But here are some risk factors:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Major provokes

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Surgery
  \item
    Major trauma
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Minor provoked

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Shorter periods of immobility - a few days sick in bed with the flu
  \item
    Contraceptive pill - depending on whether it was just started or the
    patient has been taking for two to three years
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

In the guideline document is a big, long list of other things where for
people to think about it and consider.

In this review we are discussing mostly lower extremity DVTs, however
catheter-associated DVTs are sometimes encountered on examinations. In
general the DVT is considered to be a result of the line. However,
management is treatment of the DVT with or without line removal. If the
line is functioning well and the patient requires the line for other
therapy, then simply treating the DVT with anticoagulation should be
sufficient.(Kearon, Akl, Ornelas, Blaivas, Jimenez, Bounameaux, Huisman,
King, Morris, Sood, and al. 2016; Kovacs et al. 2007) Treatment is
similar in patients with cancer.(Debourdeau et al. 2009)

Prevention is a key component to mitigating the impacts of DVT. One of
the more common risk stratification tools in the United States is the
Caprini risk assessment model.(Bahl et al. 2010) Patients identified to
be high risk according to the Caprini risk index require mechanical
prophylaxis, pharmacological prophylaxis and early ambulation.(Gould et
al. 2012; Laryea and Champagne 2013)

\textbf{In those patients where, after you've taken a thorough history,
there's no obvious provoking factors. Is there a role for screening for
occult malignancies and thrombophilias?}

For thrombophilia testing, the history of it is really interesting. When
they were first identified and our ability to screen them first became
available, there's a lot of excitement because people thought they were
going to be able to identify a clear cause for all of these unprovoked
DVTs. The reality is that at least 50\% of them, there's no identifiable
thrombophilia. So what it almost certainly means is there's lots of
thrombophilias that we haven't yet identified, we can't test for. So it
hasn't really been the panacea in that regard. The other pragmatic
reality for the thrombophilias is that if we're going to be putting
people on long-term anticoagulation anyway, the additional value of
testing for these things is really very minimal.

And the ones that are really important---the thrombosis history is so
stark that they normally smack you in the face. So I think it's
generally gone out of fashion. And again, there's only very specific
circumstances where we would suggest testing them:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  If you're going to be trying to stop anticoagulation, for some reason,
  the patients don't want to be on it, or if there's bleeding risks
\item
  There's a clear family history. Then it might be worth excluding some
  of the more sinister thrombophilias.
\end{enumerate}

Otherwise, certainly not a role for routine testing and similarly for
malignancy---for unprovoked DVT, the prevalence of an underlying
malignancy is somewhere between 6-10\%. The studies that have looked at
an aggressive, thorough assessment process rather than a more selective
process, have picked up a few more cancers, but the additional cost in
terms of anxiety, additional investigations, et cetera, and no
demonstrable improvement in outcome has meant that the guidelines have
not recommended routine cancer screening beyond the appropriate, symptom
driven age and sex specific screening---PSA, breast assessments,
colonoscopy, etc.

One unique situation is recurrent or migratory superficial vein
thrombosis, particularly in older patients, can be associated with an
underlying malignancy.(Litzendorf and Satiani 2011)

For patients with established diagnosis of thrombophilia (Factor V
Leiden homozygous mutation, antithrombin deficiency, prothrombin G20201A
homozygous) who become pregnant, recommendations state they should be on
LMWH prophylaxis during pregnancy and 6w postpartum regardless of
personal history of DVT.(Heit et al. 2005)

\hypertarget{evaluation-25}{%
\subsection{Evaluation}\label{evaluation-25}}

\textbf{What is the algorithm for investigation?}

The most important part is the first component of the algorithm, which
is an assessment of the pre-test probability of DVT. So anyone who comes
with a DVT, you can go through a validated tool. The most common is the
Wells probability score, which is a series of questions and give you an
indication as to whether a DVT is likely or unlikely. (Tritschler et al.
2018)

If a DVT is likely, then the algorithm is to do a scan, very
straightforward. If a DVT is unlikely, then the algorithm is to do a
D-dimer. Because if that is negative, DVT is effectively excluded. The
guidelines are very clear on the assessment process, but a lot of this
won't reach our radars as vascular specialists at all until the DVT has
been diagnosed, so we don't appreciate the importance of the early
stages. So again, a quick plug for the guidelines, there's a very nice
algorithm, beautiful colors---I definitely recommend having a look.

On ultrasound, acute DVT is characterized by an enlarged vein with a
non-compressible lumen and hypoechoic thrombus. Chronic post-thrombotic
scarring is often contracted with echogenic appearance.(Yusof et al.
2019) For more details, see Section~\ref{sec-venous}.

\textbf{So the exact choice and duration of anticoagulation in the
management of a DVT is probably beyond the scope of this podcast, but on
the whole are DOACs preferred over vitamin K antagonists, such as
Warfarin and why?}

In a word, yes, lots and lots of studies, funded by big companies that
make DOACs, have been done and they've all shown fairly consistent
things. They've shown that the DOACs are as effective as the vitamin K
antagonists at preventing DVT. They have almost always a significantly
lower bleeding risk, but they've got this enormous added convenience of
not needing regular blood tests, not having this dietary limitations,
and the erratic control, et cetera. So the general direction of travel
is inexorably towards more and more use of DOACs.

A couple of other areas where DOACs have really shined: The tendency is
to recommend longer courses of anticoagulation and often indefinite
anticoagulation. A number of studies, both rivaroxaban and Apixaban have
looked at the effect of a lower dose of DOAC in these patients. So if
you need to extend anticoagulation, can you use a lower dose, a
prophylactic dose, so 10mg of rivaroxaban or 2.5mg BID of Apixaban. The
results have been impressive because the prevention of recurrent VTE is
very good, the same as the therapeutic dose, but the bleeding risk is
much lower. So you've got this additional benefit of being able to give
an even load those with even lower bleeding risk.

And the real icing on the cake for the DOAC has been a few recent
studies that have been looking at cancer patients. Traditionally cancer
patients where low-molecular weight heparin only, not for DOACs.(Kearon,
Akl, Ornelas, Blaivas, Jimenez, Bounameaux, Huisman, King, Morris, Sood,
and al. 2016) But the Hokusai study(Raskob et al. 2018) and the
Caravaggio study(Agnelli et al. 2020) more recently have both looked at
Edoxaban and Apixaban in the context of cancer and have shown that
actually they're very effective. In addition, a recent meta-analysis
found that recurrence rates were lower with DOACs, but bleeding rates
were no different.(Dong et al. 2019; Rossel et al. 2019)

In almost all of the areas, DOACs are demonstrating their superiority.
The one very notable exception is antiphospholipid syndrome,
particularly triple positive antiphospholipid syndrome. This is a pretty
nasty acquired thrombophilia where Warfarin is still the gold
standard.(Pengo et al. 2018)

To step back a little, trainees should make sure they understand some
basics behind the coagulation pathway and anticoagulants. Warfarin is
one of the most studied and longest used anticoagulants and is a Vitamin
K antagonist. Vit K is essential for activation of factors IX, X, VII,
prothrombin (II), C and S, which are integral to the extrinsic pathway
of coagulation.(Fair, Marlar, and Levin 1986; Wu, Morris, and Stafford
1991) The extrinsic pathway is activated by vessel wall damage and
exposure of tissue thromboplastin or tissue factor (TF), which binds
Factor VIIa activating Factor X and Xa.(Morrissey 2001)

Warfarin induced skin necrosis is important to understand, although very
rare (0.01-0.1\%). This occurs shortly after initiating warfarin and
presents with purple, cool, painful toes and punctate areas of necrosis
and petechiae. Treatment includes immediate cessation of warfarin and
transition to LMWH, normalization of INR with Vit K and FFP.(Pourdeyhimi
and Bullard 2014; H. A. Tran et al. 2013)

\textbf{\emph{Reversal agents are also another tested topic in the
medical management of vascular disease. Other anticoagulants and their
reversal agents include:}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Dabigitran - Idarucizumab.(Glund et al. 2019)
\item
  Edoxaban, apixiban and rivaroxaban - andexanet alfa.(Connolly et al.
  2019)
\item
  Nonspecific with some effect on other DOACs - PPC, Factor 7, and
  activated PPC.(Cuker et al. 2019; Kearon, Akl, Ornelas, Blaivas,
  Jimenez, Bounameaux, Huisman, King, Morris, Sood, and al. 2016)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{\emph{Finally it is also good to be aware of a few additional
coagulation factors and their function:}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Integrin glycoprotein GPIa/IIa - platelet aggregation
\item
  Protease-activated receptors (PARs) - platelet aggregation
\item
  Thrombomodulin - activation of protein C
\item
  Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 - suppression of plasmin
  formation/fibrinolysis.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Patients with a proximal DVT, in the iliofemoral or the
femoropopliteal segment, is there a role for elastic compression in the
acute phase?}

Traditionally people have been a bit nervous about putting compression
on patients with acute DVT, concerns about causing propagation and
causing PEs. A very important study was the ideal DVT study(Ten
Cate-Hoek et al. 2018), run by Dutch colleagues, and a number of other
additional studies more recently that have built on the original IDEAL
DVT study.(Schreurs et al. 2022)

The short answer to your question is that early compression is really
important. It's a really positive thing to do within 24 hours and it's
proper compression. It's not just the Ted stocking and see what happens.
It's 30 to 40 mmHg, so that in practice is a class two stocking with a
bandage on top. The benefits are that this reduces the early pain and
swelling of the DVT, but also interestingly, it reduces the risk of
post-thrombotic syndrome and post-thrombotic venous obstruction. So if
you put compression on early, it reduces the risk of them developing
post-thrombotic syndrome. So a lot of focus has been on clearing the
vein and early thrombus removal and thrombolysis and thrombectomy and
all this sort of aggressive stuff. But just by doing the compression, we
can have at least part of the same effect and we've just not been doing
it. Very rarely do these patients get proper compression.

So there is a big section in the ESVS guidelines about the role of
compression and algorithm as to when, how to use it, and how long do you
use it for. What we want to see now is the DVT pathways around the
country, around the world, updated and amended with this latest
guidance.(Kakkos et al. 2021)

\hypertarget{complications---pulmonary-embolism}{%
\paragraph{Complications - Pulmonary
Embolism}\label{complications---pulmonary-embolism}}

More and more vascular surgeons are becoming involved with
\textbf{\emph{Pulmonary Embolism Response Teams (PERT)}} and so surgeons
should be familiar with the acute management of DVTs that progress to
pulmonary embolism. The majority of pulmonary embolisms simply require
anticoagulation.

However, if a patient becomes hemodynamically unstable, such as develops
hypotension, then the patient should undergo systemic
thrombolysis.(Kearon, Akl, Ornelas, Blaivas, Jimenez, Bounameaux,
Huisman, King, Morris, Sood, and al. 2016) Contraindications to systemic
thrombolysis include:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Age \textgreater75
\item
  Intracranial neoplasm
\item
  Intracranial/spinal surgery or trauma with the last 2 months
\item
  History of hemorrhagic stroke
\item
  Active bleeding or known bleeding disorder
\item
  Non-hemorrhagic stroke within the past 3 months.
\end{itemize}

Patients who do not immediately respond to systemic thrombolysis, are a
high risk of bleeding, or in shock that may cause death before
thrombolytics take effect, then catheter based thrombus removal may be
considered. This complex decision making is best made through the
previously mentioned PERT.(Eleftherios S. Xenos et al. 2019)
Endovascular techniques include:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Thrombus fragmentation
\item
  Suction thrombectomy
\item
  Rotational embolectomy
\item
  Ultrasound assisted thrombolysis
\end{itemize}

There are very high risk procedures and complications include pulmonary
artery perforation, pericardial tamponade, cardiogenic shock,
hemaglobinuria or other hemorrhagic complications.

\hypertarget{complications---post-thrombotic-syndrome}{%
\paragraph{Complications - Post Thrombotic
Syndrome}\label{complications---post-thrombotic-syndrome}}

\textbf{One of the concerning complications of a DVT, particularly a
proximal DVT is post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). Can you recap the
symptoms of PTS and how it's diagnosed?}

PTS is a fairly amorphous entity that includes a series of patient
symptoms and clinical signs that develop after deep vein thrombosis.
That's deliberately very vague, because the condition is so variable. In
terms of diagnosing PTS, the official diagnostic tool is a score of five
or more on the Villalta scale. The Villalta score is another one of
these tools that have been developed for both making a diagnosis, but
also assessing progression of PTS.(Kahn et al. 2014; Villalta et al.
1994)

But in terms of sort of symptoms---people get swelling, heaviness, pain.
There is a very unique symptom, which is venous claudication, which is
almost pathonogmonic of post-thrombotic syndrome with venous outflow
obstruction. It's this pain which has a bursting tense quality in the
calf on exertion, which does settle on stopping, but it takes a lot
longer than arterial claudication. So sometimes people will take half an
hour to get better and the leg has to be elevated. So that's venous
claudication and that's often the most disabling symptom. But of course,
people can develop the same clinical complications than you can with any
venous disease---skin changes, lipodermatosclerosis, venous leg
ulceration, et cetera. Those are the summery of symptoms for PTS, seen
in up to 50\% but probably closer to 25\% of proximal DVT.

\hypertarget{complications---ivc-filters}{%
\paragraph{Complications - IVC
Filters}\label{complications---ivc-filters}}

\textbf{A quick question about IVC filters. As vascular surgeons, we
sometimes get asked about the appropriateness of inserting an IVC
filter. When would you consider one and how long can one stay in situ
for?}

So short answer is I virtually never consider one, and if already in
situ, remove as soon as possible. Let's expand on this a little bit. So
the history of IVC filters is a painful story, particularly in the US,
super aggressive use of IVC filters, very few of them retrieved, lots of
IVC occlusions, and major lawsuits against big companies. The most
important factor in successful IVC filter retrieval is dwell time less
than 7 months. Type of filter, tilting or protruding struts are not
associated with failure. Adverse events have found to be as high as
2\%.(Desai et al. 2017) That's led to a worldwide, reluctance to use IVC
filter, so now we may not be using them in some cases when we should be
using them. The traditional indications and reasons for using IVC
filters included weird and wonderful things like floating thrombus and
other factors.

The reality is the only real indication that we could come up with was
when there's a proximal DVT, and there's a clear contraindication to
anticoagulation. So if there's no anticoagulation, then the risk of
propagation and PE is reasonably high, so there is a strong case for a
temporary IVC filter. If a patient is anticoagulated, very rarely can
the case be made for an IVC filter. I don't want to go into nuanced
details---such as where somebody already had a PE there's right heart
strain, there may be some anatomical features that you're worried about,
their anticoagulant control is borderline---there might be specific
cases, but this is really very rare. Most people anticoagulated do not
need an IVC filter.

A rather challenging and unique patient would be a pregnant patient with
a DVT and placenta previa. Anticoagulation is contraindicated in
placenta previa and in addition, an infrarenal IVC filter is also
contraindicated, so she would require a suprarenal IVC filter.(Bates et
al. 2018; DeYoung and Minocha 2016; Harris, Velineni, and Davies 2016)

In the setting of a thrombosed filter, a patient may require urgent
intervention if they develop phlegmasia. Suprarenal filter placement may
be useful during the procedure to prevent embolization. Removal of the
IVC filter is contraindicated unless all clot is cleared.(Sheth et al.
2015; Teter et al. 2019)

\hypertarget{surgery-3}{%
\subsubsection{Surgery}\label{surgery-3}}

\textbf{So clot burden reduction techniques are a hot topic at the
moment. Before we talk about endovenous techniques, is there a role for
surgical venous thrombectomy? And when would you consider this?}

Open thrombectomy is part of the spectrum of early thrombus removal
techniques. It used to be very popular, a very satisfying technique---I
think I've done it three times. They've all been for the same sort of
indication, which is phlegmasia, severe limb threatening post DVT
change, and in a patient where they weren't candidates for thrombolysis.
However, if you're with a patient where the leg is threatened, you can't
anticoagulate them, you can't thrombolize them. Then in that case this
is a sort of last ditch approach. But if that's not the case, then
almost always a catheter based approach is less invasive and more
acceptable.

In addition, most people have got more training. Trainees should read
some of the descriptions of open thrombectomy--- it's a very satisfying
technique, but it's quite involved. It involves finding and exposing the
common femoral, deep femoral and femoral veins, applying tight
compression around the lower leg to milk the clots out distally to
proximally. So the original descriptions are really interesting, but
really very rarely would we need to do that.(Comerota and Aziz 2019)

\hypertarget{endovascular-2}{%
\subsubsection{Endovascular}\label{endovascular-2}}

\textbf{So you've mentioned catheter directed techniques for clot burden
reduction. Some recent trials have challenged our thinking on the
appropriateness of these techniques, such as the ATTRACT and the CaVent
trial. What's your take on the current evidence?}

This is very controversial. The fundamental issue here is that the
trials that have been done almost certainly would not have included a
large number of people who would benefit from interventions in the
opinion of the investigators. So if somebody has got severe DVT, it is
unlikely, particularly in the US, where the ATTRACT trial was done, but
these people would have been randomized into the trial.

So the immediate criticism of the trials is that this is not reflective
of the population. You've excluded the people that benefit, so it's an
underestimate of the benefit of the technique. But if we look at trial
results ourselves, there is a modest benefit. In the CaVent trial, PTS
rate was reduced. The quality of life was less impressive, but the PTS
rate was reduced moderately.(Haig et al. 2016) And in the ATTRACT trial,
when they subgroup analyzed the iliofemoral DVT group, then there was a
reduction in the number of people who develop moderate and severe PTS.
So I think the numbers are something along the lines of, you'd have to
treat 10 people with thrombus removal to prevent one person developing
moderate to severe PTS.(Vedantham et al. 2017)

So then the discussion is are those numbers needed to treat appropriate
for intervention? Particularly when you then start to consider the
additional need for stenting and long-term surveillance, et cetera. So I
think the jury is very much out. You've got really stark, strong, firmly
held unshiftable views on both sides of the argument and what we need is
a bit of nuance. What we need is everyone accepts that some people
benefit let's all work together, try and work out, which people benefit.
Let's work on case selection.

\textbf{So we'll put you on the spot then, when would you offer
thrombolysis? Which patients would you offer it in and which
circumstances would you also stent?}

There's no role for thrombolysis in anything other than the iliofemoral
segment. So if it's infrainguinal, proximal DVT, even if its severely
symptomatic, the studies that actually you cause harm by attempting
early thrombus removal. That's the first important point.

Even if they have got severe symptoms, there's always a role for initial
conservative management, compression with elevation and a lot of these
people have a dramatic improvement in their symptoms. If they don't, and
there's an honest discussion, and the bleeding risk is low then
potentially there is a role. But when there's a treatment with a
borderline benefit or the benefit is unclear, then I think what we've
gotta do pick low risk patients, so low bleeding risk. We've got to
choose teams and techniques with the highest risk of technical success.
And we've got to pick people where we think the benefit is greatest,
i.e.~those that have the highest risk of PTS.

Whether or not you stent is very difficult. We had a case not so long
ago where we had a very nice result from early thrombus removal, we
stented, and the patients thrombosed again early and subsequently was
identified to have triple positive antiphospholipid syndrome. Obviously
there wasn't the opportunity in the time to make that diagnosis prior to
the decisions around the thrombus removal, so you end up stung and now
this patient has a stent and can be very difficult to open up again. The
advocates and the aggressive stenters would say, you can't leave a
significant stenosis after thrombus removal, otherwise they will
rethrombose. Whereas others will say, if we go back to the early
studies, like CaVent, very few, if any, people actually had stents, but
actually their results were still reasonable.

I think once you get on the roller coaster of thrombus removal, it's
very difficult not to then proceed also to stenting, if you see a
significant lesion, for example, at the May-Thurner point.(W. Wang et
al. 2018; Meissner et al. 2012; Rollo et al. 2017) Final comment, I'll
make is that the use of recanalization and stenting for chronic PTS is a
very effective technique. So another approach, if you're not sure, is to
manage them conservatively, but always have that up your sleeve, if they
get significant PTS at six months, no earlier, then we could potentially
consider recanalizing and stenting at that point.

\textbf{Following thrombolysis, what duration of anticoagulation is
required?}

So the whole point of anticoagulation after DVT is to reduce the risk of
propagation and pulmonary embolus, firstly, but also then to reduce the
risk of recurrent VTE. The aims don't really change if you thrombolyzed
or if you put a stent in. Some people used to say, I put a stent in,
we've treated the May-Thurner and that was the main cause of DVT, so we
can stop the anticoagulation. That's not the case. So it shouldn't
change and it shouldn't be any shorter if you've thrombolize and put a
stent in.

Now, whether it should be longer because you put a stent in that's
debatable. Some people have very aggressive anticoagulation protocols
after stenting, but that's to do with the stent rather than the DVT. So
remember the aims, which are to reduce the risk of recurrent DVT and PE
and to stop propagation of the current event.

\hypertarget{phlegmasia}{%
\section{Phlegmasia}\label{phlegmasia}}

\textbf{Some patients may present with very profound, lower limb
swelling. Pain and cyanosis with a threat to viability of the limb. Can
you explain for us what phlegmasia is and an approach to treatment?}

There's two sorts phlegmasia that are described, but to be honest, I
don't think anybody has a detailed and robust understanding of what
these actually mean. Phelgmasia alba dolens is the
\href{https://www.google.com/search?q=Phlegmasia+alba+dolens\&client=safari\&rls=en\&sxsrf=ALiCzsY3xqSSjZro2T2oiRHzVPLniGwqAQ:1665422481903\&source=lnms\&tbm=isch\&sa=X\&ved=2ahUKEwj727ybltb6AhXJoWoFHe3xCsMQ_AUoAXoECAEQAw\&biw=1121\&bih=1148\&dpr=1}{white

leg} and the severe, form a phlegmasia. Theoretically, cerulea dolens
has a limb loss rate of 30-40\%-\/-severe limb threat, compartment
syndrome, skin blistering, swelling, etc. The reality is that it's often
over-diagnosed, so you'll see a lot of people saying I did venous
thrombolysis for phlegmasia and it's just a big swollen engorged leg.

The reason it happens is almost certainly a profound obstruction of
venous outflow. So the venous blood in the leg cannot escape. You get
this cycle of worsening pressure, leaking of fluid from the capillaries,
increasing pressure on the soft tissues. Then that starts to threaten
tissue perfusion and potentially if it's bad enough this will threaten
the actual arterial profusion of the leg as well. Presentation often
includes iliofemoral DVT with non-palpable pulses and loss of sensation
with out improvement on anticoagulation and elevation. Endovascular
early thrombus removal is the first line with fasciotomies, with open
thrombectomy as back up for salvage.(Erdoes et al. 2011; Thomas,
Hollingsworth, and Mofidi 2019)

So that's the sort of most severe and extreme form. I don't think
anybody has confidently linked the anatomical findings and features of a
DVT to what the leg looks like. There was a patient I saw who literally
had every deep vein acutely thrombosed from the IVC down to both lower
legs and was almost asymptomatic. So we've got this very uncomfortable
lack of understanding between the symptoms and the clinical and
anatomical pattern of DVT.

\hypertarget{deep-venous-obstruction}{%
\section{Deep Venous Obstruction}\label{deep-venous-obstruction}}

\hypertarget{etiology-10}{%
\subsection{Etiology}\label{etiology-10}}

\textbf{So finally, let's move on to talk about the treatment of
proximal deep venous insufficiency, both obstruction and incompetence.
What are the common causes for deep venous obstruction? Thinking about
post-thrombotic and non-thrombotic obstructions.}

So again, the terminology is important. So it's venous outflow
obstruction. Obstruction implies that there's a physiological issue
causing the consequences. As opposed to occlusion, which is an
anatomical term. So venous outflow obstruction, is essentially anything
that reduces the ability of venous blood to escape the leg via deep
venous channels will cause an obstruction.

And again, going back to a bit of physiology.
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagen–Poiseuille_equation}{Poiseuille's
Law} talks about the flow rate being proportional to the fourth power of
the radius. So it's really interesting. A question to ask is that if
you've got a two centimeter vein, how many, one centimeter veins would
it take to carry the same potential flow as a single two centimeter
vein?

The long story short is that it takes 16 one centimeter veins to carry
the same amounts of potential flow as a single two centimeter vein. So
it doesn't take much of a narrowing to have a great potential impact on
flow. Of course, most of the time, you don't need that flow potential,
it's only an absolute extremes of circulatory stress that you'll need
that sort of potential, but it is interesting. And again, it also
challenges when people say there's great collaterals and that will be
enough. Well unless they're enormous, you need 16 of them to have the
same potential blood carrying capacity.

So in terms of the causes, the most common by far is post-thrombotic
disease. So when you've had a DVT, one of three things happens. If
you're lucky, the vein will recanalize completely. If you're unlucky, it
will obstruct completely. And if you're somewhere in between, you'll end
up with partial stenosis and obstruction. What's important is even if
the vein is open, what you almost always lose in the post-thrombotic
vein is venous compliance. It's not the same compliant vein that can
respond to demands and physiological need that you have, in a primary
non-scarred vein.

Other potential causes are a non-thrombotic iliac vein lesion, or
\textbf{\emph{May-Thurner lesion}}. So the original paper, 1957, is very
interesting reading.(May and Thurner 1957) There were a couple of
Austrian pathologists who identified that a very high proportion of
people, particularly those had left-sided DVT had, not only the
overriding iliac artery causing compression, but they had a secondary
tight fibrosis in the iliac vein.(Nazzal et al. 2015) So it's not just
the compression because any one of us in a certain position we'll have a
squashed vein. It's the fact that there's a secondary inflammatory
fibrotic change, which is what's causing the obstruction. So that's a
true May-Thurner or non-thrombotic lesion.(Liddell and Evans 2018; Rollo
et al. 2017)

The other big group of patients of course, is malignant lymph node or
retroperitoneal fibrosis related venous outflow obstruction. For
example, a patient with a large retroperitoneal leiomyosarcoma may be
involving the vena cava. In this case, these patients may require en
bloc resection of the IVC and reconstruction with ringed PTFE, sized off
the preoperative imaging.(Quinones-Baldrich et al. 2012; Fiore et al.
2012) But in the end, post-thrombotic by far was the most commonly
diagnosed pathology.

\hypertarget{evaluation-26}{%
\subsection{Evaluation}\label{evaluation-26}}

\textbf{We may see patients who come in with severe venous disease with
skin changes, for example. When would you consider imaging the proximal
deep veins in addition to infrainguinal superficial and deep veins of
the leg and what are the best modalities to do this?}

So we are really getting down to the importance of a detailed assessment
of the entire superficial and deep venous system. Every patient with
venous disease should have a whole leg infrainguinal duplex to start
with---that's deep and superficial veins. There's no real role for just
looking at superficial veins. So you need to understand the context. In
terms of if their obstructed or if they're refluxing. Again, remember
that, reflux on a duplex, yes, all we see is arrows going in certain
directions. But all reflux means is that after a calf augmentation
maneuver, there is some retrograde flow---in a superficial vein, more
than half a second and in a deep vein, more than one second. That's all
it means. So for example, you can have retrograde flow for 0.6 seconds
in a saphenous vein, and that will be labeled as reflux for all the rest
of the time that superficial vein is doing the right job, it's returning
the blood to the heart. So just be wary of interpreting what these
arrows mean. For more, see Section~\ref{sec-venous}.

In terms of how that affects your decision-making---one approach is to
consider the overall burden of venous disease, such as those with venous
hypertension. And what I try and do is draw a pie chart and say, you got
venous hypertension, here are the different causes of your venous
disease---that might include superficial reflux, deep venous reflux,
deep venous obstruction, and other factors. You try and apply some
clinical judgment as to what the different factors are.

Now, even if they've got significant, deep venous reflux and superficial
venous reflux, there is still a role for treating superficial reflux in
most of these cases. I still come across colleagues and other people who
say, look, you shouldn't treat the superficial veins if there's deep
reflux. But all the studies---EVRA, ESCHAR-\/-have shown significant
benefits, even if there's deep flux.(Manjit S. Gohel et al. 2007; Manjit
S. Gohel et al. 2018) So again, the key message is treat the superficial
reflux if it's there. However, if the patient has isolated deep reflux
then management is limited to wound care and compression, often as high
as 40-50mmHg. Some series have found that 70-80\% will heal.(O'Donnell
et al. 2014; Maleti and Perrin 2011)

Now, deep venous obstruction and looking for it is a different matter.
There are again, lots of approaches, some people are very aggressive
about evaluating the iliac veins---CTVs and IVUS on everybody. The
problem is if you get super aggressive, then you start to over-diagnose
and if you start to over-diagnose, you start to over treat and this all
gets very messy.

I think the sort of people that have clear signs and symptoms of major
venous outflow obstruction, particularly venous claudication, history of
previous DVT, really disproportionate venous changes to the superficial
and the infrainguinal imaging. Proximal obstruction can present with
atypical proximal varicose veins in the mons pubis, perineum, buttock,
high posterior/lateral thigh, abdominal wall. These findings are 93\%
predictive of deep venous obstruction proximal to the inguinal
ligament.(Kurstjens et al. 2016) Those are the people that I would
image.

And on the duplex imaging of the leg, if there are changes in the common
femoral vein that make you think there is a proximal problem,
particularly a loss of phasicity of flow then that's pretty concerning
for a significant venous outflow problem. In an unobstructed venous
system, the common femoral vein should really reflect the right hearts,
which has some phasicity. There should be transmission of that
respiratory phasicity. So if that isn't there, then you're thinking,
hang on, there's something interrupting that transmission, which is
almost always an obstruction somewhere. So those are the people I'd
image, but I wouldn't over image---because then you end up with a
headache and a problem---Should I treat or should I not treat?

\textbf{So you mentioned IVUS, what is intravascular ultrasound and what
are the particular benefits of using this technique over venography
alone?}

IVUS is a 9F probe that is inserted into the vein and it gives you a 360
degree view in B-mode ultrasound---traditionally without color flow,
just B mode---of the anatomical structures. What it's very useful for is
identifying venous anatomy, confluences, identifying the size of veins,
so it allows you to plan sizes of stents. It really is an important
adjunct to venography and other imaging modalities. We did our first 30
or so cases of deep venous stenting without IVUS and thought we were
brilliant and IVUS was a waste of money. And then we started using IVUS
and realized I can't believe we were doing this without. Once you start
using it, you suddenly realize that it's a really useful adjunct.
\textbf{\emph{Recommended oversizing for vein stenting is 10-15\% of
largest diameter of adjacent vein.}}(Gloviczki et al. 2011; O'Donnell et
al. 2014; Raju, Owen, and Neglen 2002; Raju, Darcey, and Neglén 2010)

In terms of when you use it, in some parts of the world it's commonly
used for diagnostic purposes, but beware of the risk of over-diagnosis.
More commonly, almost routinely, IVUS is used for therapeutic,
particularly when we're stenting deep veins to plan our landing zones.
When CTA/MRA shows compression, it must be confirmed with IVUS prior to
treatment. IVUS has far greater sensitivity and specificity and must
show a cross-sectional surface area reduction of greater than
50\%.(Gagne et al. 2018; Forauer et al. 2002)

\textbf{You talked about over-diagnosis. Can you talk us through some of
the decision-making processes that you go through when you're assessing
a patient who has a deep venous obstruction?}

There are lots of patients that have this anatomical change, the number
of referrals I get from people who have done a CT and they've picked up
a problem. The most important thing is the clinical status and the
clinical picture. So have they got symptoms---go about right at the
beginning of the podcast---have they got symptoms? Have they got
complications? If they haven't got significant symptoms and they haven't
got significant complications then there's not really an indication for
treatments.

So leg swelling was initially, frequently pushed as, oh you're swelling
will get better, if we get rid of your obstruction. That's only the case
in probably less than 50\% of patients. The reason for that is that, yes
the original etiology for the swelling may well have been venous, but
you almost always get a secondary lymphatic dysfunction when you've had
swelling, for whatever reason---whether it's heart failure, whether it's
venous, the lymphatic system gets damaged. And so even if you get rid of
the original cause, the lymphatic damage persists, of course, and the
swelling persists.

The symptoms are very important and in terms of complications, if
somebody has intractable ulceration, et cetera, these are all important
indications. But a bit of skin change, a bit of mild swelling, careful
case selection is very important for these procedures.

\subsection{Management}\label{management-40}}

\hypertarget{endovascular-3}{%
\subsubsection{Endovascular}\label{endovascular-3}}

There is variability in the availability of stents for venous
obstruction. However, closed cell braided stents (i.e.~the Wallstent)
have been around for many years and has the most data related to long
term durability.(Gagne et al. 2019) These stents have the least radial
force at the ends, so it is recommended to extent 1-2cm beyond the
venous obstruction. In cases of proximal iliac vein obstruction, this
may require extending into the IVC 1-2cm which may cross, or ``jail''
the contralateral iliac vein. When jailed, the rate of DVT on that side
has been reported as high as 10\%.(E. H. Murphy et al. 2017; Le et al.
2018)

\textbf{So following a deep venous recanalization and stenting, what
surveillance do you offer for these patients?}

Surveillance has been evolving. The first availability CE (UK version of
FDA) marked deep venous stents in the UK was around 2012. A few services
across the country really got started at a few centers in 2012, 2013.
Initially there was an early scan and then a scan maybe at six weeks and
three or six months down the line.

I think we realized that in general, the people that developed problems,
often develop them very early. So we are scanning these people the day
after the intervention---obviously there's intraoperative quality
control and venograms and scanning---but the day after the intervention
to ensure that there's no early thrombus problems. Then we scan a couple
of weeks after to make sure that there's nothing that's happened early,
because there's an opportunity to re-intervene, to balloon, to correct
any technical issues, at that point. After that point, it's usually six
weeks, three months, six months, and then annually thereafter.

So that's a sort of protocol that we have and in general, what we've
seen is that people that develop problems tend to develop them
relatively early. So once you get to a year, then in general, the
patency rates are very good. In our center, the the chronic PTS stenting
primary patency rates at around three years are over 80\%-85\%. Of
course, there are some that have problems, but it's important to
remember that, even those that have thrombosed, they generally go back
to the level of symptoms they have prior to intervention. Which is very
reassuring. The last thing you want to do is to make people worse with a
novel intervention.

\textbf{And so what about your anticoagulation and antiplatelet regime
for these patients?}

There was a systematic review done a few years ago where all of the
published literature for deep venous stenting was reviewed and I think
the authors identified 28 different regimens for anticoagulation of the
stenting.(Notten, Ten Cate, and Ten Cate-Hoek 2021) The honest answer is
nobody knows, our approach is to have low molecular weight heparin as
the primary anticoagulant for the initial two week period. And then at
the two week point, they undergo a stent. If there's no issues, they get
transitioned to a DOAC.

In addition, the patients get six weeks of clopidogrel as an
anti-platelet. And again, the reason for that is that it's a foreign
material into the vein. Yes, the role of anti-platelets in preventing
venous thrombosis is very limited but there has to be some platelet
related activity and platelet activation involved there. So it makes
logical sense to have some anti-platelet activity. Of course the
downside is that there's an increasing bleeding risk. These are the
constant tightropes that you're walking with these patients.

\end{tcolorbox}

\hypertarget{surgery-4}{%
\subsubsection{Surgery}\label{surgery-4}}

\textbf{We've talked about endovascular and endovenous treatments, but
is there a role for open surgery in these patients?}

So in the iliac segment, very rarely. In some patients, you can do PTFE
reconstructions and bypasses. And of course the traditional operations
of Palma-Dale(Palma and Esperon 1960) bypass and May-Husni(Shaydakov,
Porembskaya, and Geroulakos 2015) type procedures. They all sounded very
elegant in the books, but the reality is a great saphenous vein going
across the lower abdomen to the other side is not really going to sort
the problem out in a durable way for all sorts of obvious reasons---the
size of the vein, the pressure and all that sort of stuff. So there's
really very limited role for those sorts of procedures.

Now, the one area where there may be a role for open reconstruction is
in the common femoral vein. The consistent observation is that good
inflow is absolutely imperative to get good outcomes in these patients.
And sometimes if the common femoral vein has got a lot of scarring, then
it's very difficult to reconstruct that inflow endovascularly. So a
number of authors have advocated the use of endophlebectomy, opening up
the common femoral vein, and cutting out the scarring and the
tribulations, putting a patch on it. Sometimes even putting an AV
fistula---a little six millimeter graph from the common femoral artery
onto the vein to really drive the flow through the stent. It's a pretty
complicated operation and you can imagine you're dissecting down and
there's lots of little veins everywhere and lots of lymphatics. The
wound complication rate is very high.

So really very limited role only---the endovascular approach is really
the way forward for these patients.

\hypertarget{pelvic-congestive-syndrome}{%
\section{Pelvic Congestive Syndrome}\label{pelvic-congestive-syndrome}}

\hypertarget{presentation-13}{%
\subsection{Presentation}\label{presentation-13}}

\textbf{So finally, let's talk about pelvic congestion syndrome. What is
pelvic congestion syndrome and how does it present?}

So it often doesn't present anywhere near a vascular surgeon. There are
a number of women who present with these chronic heaviness and dragging
symptoms in the lower abdomen. There may be some association with
menses, there's often dyspareunia and a whole variety of other symptoms.

There may be associated vulvar varices or posterior buttock and thigh
varices all as a result of pelvic venous incompetence. Knowing the
proximal anatomy of the saphenous vein tributaries is important, as the
pudendal vein tributary connects vulvar veins and inferior gluteal vein
connects to the posterior buttock.(Iafrati and Donnell 2019) But it's a
complicated field---there are some people that have pelvic symptoms,
there are some people that have the varicose veins or some will have a
combination of the two. Almost always they will be seen and initially
assessed by the gynecology teams rather than coming to the vascular
surgeons.

\hypertarget{evaluation-and-management}{%
\subsection{Evaluation and Management}\label{evaluation-and-management}}

\textbf{When we do see these patients, are there any treatment options
available for them? And when would you consider treating?}

\textbf{I}n a highly selective way---this is venous disease in a
nutshell---the association between anatomical changes and clinical
symptoms is ropey at best. In terms of postpartum women, an enormous
proportion of these women have got venous reflux in the pelvis---if you
look hard enough. so the problem is similar to that of May-Thurner
syndrome, if you start looking hard enough, you start identifying these
symptoms and then you lose the ability to really discern who's going to
benefit most.

So again, I would go back to clinical symptoms as the single most
important thing. If they've got severe clinical symptoms majorly
affecting their quality of life and associated significant venous
changes, then those people to try to intervene on. It's not necessarily
a benign procedure. Pelvic vein embolization involves implantation of
coils. There's concerns about non-targeted embolization as coils have
ended up in lungs. There are a number of people with unknown nickel
allergies that have problems with these coils. So again, it's not an
area to be over aggressive. So careful case selection is important. So
again, a quick plug for the ESVS guidelines. There is a very good
section on pelvic venous disease assessment.(De Maeseneer et al. 2022)

What's very important is again, to differentiate between pelvic
congestion syndrome and pelvic origin varicosities. One thing that is
certainly being advocated is that if the varicose veins are coming from
the pelvis, but there's no pelvic congestion syndrome, it's perfectly
reasonable just to deal with the visible varicosities from below---with
some foam sclerotherapy or other treatment from below, rather than being
super aggressive embolizing from above. But I think anybody who's
involved in managing this really needs to work closely with the
gynecologists. There are gynecological diagnoses that need excluding
before we start to address the venous disease. And there are a number of
validated questionnaires and other assessment tools that are probably
quite important. So not for the faint-hearted.

\hypertarget{superior-vena-cava-svc-syndrome}{%
\section{Superior Vena Cava (SVC)
Syndrome}\label{superior-vena-cava-svc-syndrome}}

SVC syndrome is an acute presentation of head and neck venous congestion
often due to SVC obstruction. This can be intrinsic due to indwelling
devices or extrinsic due to malignancy or mediastinal fibrosis (half of
benign cases).(Kalra, Bjarnason, and Gloviczki 2019; Rice, Rodriguez,
and Light 2006; Parish et al. 1981)

\hypertarget{management-41}{%
\subsection{Management}\label{management-41}}

Angioplasty and stenting are first line treatment for benign
etiology.(Rizvi et al. 2008; Sheikh et al. 2005) Angioplasty alone may
be sufficient, but stenosis refractory to angioplasty may require
stenting. SVC syndrome with failed endovascular management in reasonable
operative candidates can undergo open reconstruction with large diameter
prosthetic graft or spiral vein graft.(Doty, Flores, and Doty 1999)
However, restenosis in open repair can be as high as 15\%.(Kalra, Sen,
and Gloviczki 2018; Sfyroeras et al. 2017)

SVC syndrome secondary to malignancy, bronchogenic or lymphoma, is often
most effectively treated with palliative radiotherapy with good
response.(Talapatra et al. 2016) Endovascular or open recannalization is
often reserved only for those with severe symptoms refractory to
radiation or chemotherapy.(Higdon and Higdon 2006) Lymphedema pumps can
help with symptom management as well.

\hypertarget{lymphedema}{%
\section{Lymphedema}\label{lymphedema}}

Here we will discuss lymphedema of the lower extremity. This is a broad
topic, but the management decisions are relatively straightforward and
knowledge is required for examinations. For upper extremity lymphedema,

\hypertarget{demographics-20}{%
\subsection{Demographics}\label{demographics-20}}

\hypertarget{etiology-11}{%
\subsubsection{Etiology}\label{etiology-11}}

Lymphedema can be thought of as a primary dysfunction of the lymphatic
channels or the secondary result of a disease that results in the
destruction of lymphatic flow. Causes of secondary lymphedema include
filariasis, which is endemic to parts of South America.(Pfarr et al.
2009; Shenoy 2008)

\hypertarget{presentation-14}{%
\subsubsection{Presentation}\label{presentation-14}}

The management of lymphedema is determined primarily on its clinical
stage at presentation.(Grada and Phillips 2017) The staging for
lymphedema is as follows:

\hypertarget{evaluation-27}{%
\subsection{Evaluation}\label{evaluation-27}}

On physical exam, a classic finding is Stemmer's sign, which is a
thickened skin fold at the based of the second toe/finger. The sign is
positive when the tissue is hardened and cannot be lifted.(S. G. Rockson
et al. 1998; Stanley G. Rockson 2019)

Lymphedema is most often diagnosed based on clinical presentation and
physical exam. Lymphoscintography can be used to confirm the diagnosis
in complex presentations and would demonstrate dermal back flow, absent
or delayed transport, crossover filling, absent or delayed visualization
of lymph beds.(Stanley G. Rockson 2019; O'Donnell, Rasmussen, and
Sevick-Muraca 2017)

\hypertarget{management-42}{%
\subsection{Management}\label{management-42}}

Treatment is best initially managed with combined decongestive therapy
(CDT) which includes an intensive reductive phase (4-8wks), followed by
life long maintenance, often with specific compression garments.(Grada
and Phillips 2017) CDT in the setting of heart failure has been reported
to lead to volume overload.(Lawenda, Mondry, and Johnstone 2009)

In extreme cases, after CDT therapy has been instituted for at least 6
months and the patient has persistent refractory symptoms, surgery may
be used for reconstruction or debulking.(Grada and Phillips 2017;
Baumeister et al. 2016)

\subsection{General Considerations}\label{general-considerations-1}}

\textbf{Exposure Basics}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Prep patient widely

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Any lower extremity injury, prep patient from umbilicus down to both
    legs
  \item
    Anticipate need for proximal control, intraoperative angiograms at
    the femoral level, and potential harvesting of saphenous vein for
    conduit
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Recommend leaving tourniquet on and prep into field

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Removing tourniquet prematurely can result in arterial bleeding,
    leading to hypotension, hemorrhagic shock, and multi-organ system
    failure
  \item
    Communicate with anesthesia and OR team when tourniquet will be put
    down and have blood ready for transfusion
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Incision

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Recommend making incision twice as long as what you would initially
    anticipate
  \item
    Important to have long incision to get appropriate control and
    visualization of injury
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Junctional Hemorrhages

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Junctional area between the torso and extremity, most difficult to
    control
  \item
    Lower extremity vessels include distal external iliac and common
    femoral

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Commonly presents as a groin hematoma
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Upper extremity vessels include subclavian and axillary

      Good for focal injuries (grazing wounds or stab wounds from a
      knife) where there is minimal tension and arterial lumen maintains
      its integrity after debridement to healthy tissue
    \item
      Can consider with venous injuries due to higher compliance or when
      vessels are redundant (ie brachial artery)
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Patch Repair

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Also good for focal injuries not amenable to primary repair
    \item
      Again, can perform if there is no concern for tension or
      compromise of arterial lumen
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Interposition graft

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Most common repair type, avoids issue of tension and compromise of
      arterial lumen
    \item
      Conduit types

      \begin{itemize}
      \item
        Autologous vein (great saphenous vein)

        \begin{itemize}
        \item
          Preferred choice with concern for contamination and for more
          distal extremity injuries (i.e.~brachial, radial, SFA, and
          popliteal)
        \item
          Saphenous vein from contralateral extremity (non-injured)
          routinely recommended
        \item
          Ipsilateral saphenous vein CAN be used if there is no deep
          vein injury and it is part of the incision/exposure
        \end{itemize}
      \item
        Prosthetic - ePTFE or Dacron

        \begin{itemize}
        \tightlist
        \item
          Suitable if vein is not available, wound with minimal
          contamination or injury is more proximal (axillary,
          subclavian, proximal femoral, iliac)
        \end{itemize}
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Ligation

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Dependent on location of injury and overall hemodynamic status of
      patient
    \item
      If patient unstable, ligate as damage control maneuver (Liang et
      al. 2016; Fox et al. 2012)
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

medicine} and the transition from ligation to arterial repair during the
Korean war.

\end{tcolorbox}

\textbf{Heparinization}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Recommend selective heparinization
\item
  If patient has isolated extremity injury, recommend systemic heparin
  during revascularization
\item
  If patient has concomitant injuries (i.e.~head trauma, torso bleeding,
  or extensive soft tissue injury), recommend regional heparin flushed
  up and down injured vessel (Liang et al. 2016; Fox et al. 2012)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Shunts}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Can be utilized in damage control maneuvers to prevent need for
  ligation and achieve temporary perfusion
\item
  Larger caliber vessels with high flow can be shunted without need for
  heparinization for 4-6 hours
\item
  Smaller caliber vessels (in distal extremities) usually clot off but
  do not cause harm when clot occurs intra-operatively as the vessel
  needs to be re-assessed for repair

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    However, recommend that shunts are used in patients that do not have
    contraindications to systemic heparin use
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Types

    Pruitt-Inahara
  \item
    Makeshift shunts -- small caliber chest tubes

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Can place in injured vessel proximally and controlled with either
      ligature around vessel to lock shunt in place or rubber vessel
      loop
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Placement

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Insert in injured vessel proximally first, then allow some pulsatile
    bleeding to allow any thrombus to exit before inserting it distally
  \item
    Shunts can be secured either with heavy silk tie or plastic vessel
    loops
  \item
    Can use doppler with water or acoustic gel over shunt to verify
    arterial flow

\end{itemize}

\textbf{Fasciotomies}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Avoid hesitation to perform 4-compartment fasciotomies in threatened
  limb ischemia
\item
  Recommend prophylactic fasciotomy to avoid compartment syndrome
\item
  Especially important when transporting patients to higher level of
  care facilities
\item

\hypertarget{iliac-vessels}{%
\subsection{Iliac Vessels}\label{iliac-vessels}}

\textbf{Exposure}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Retroperitoneal exposure preferred - oblique incision in lower
  quadrant of abdomen (i.e.~transplant incision)
\item
  Midline laparotomy can also be considered
\item
  Groin hematomas can either be iliac or femoral etiology, recommend
  extensive prep with either transplant incision or midline laparotomy
  incision to be able to gain common iliac artery control if needed
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Repair}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Internal iliac injury

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Prefer ligation

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Difficult access for exposure and repair
    \item
      Patients usually in hemorrhagic shock and control is
      time-consuming and difficult to achieve
    \item
      Can be safely achieved, pelvic ischemia rare due to collateral
      blood supply from contralateral iliac vessel
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    If repair can be performed, recommend larger needle (SH blunt tip
    needle on 3-0 or 4-0) for repair due to low visibility in pelvis
  \end{itemize}
\item
  External iliac injury

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Repair at all costs

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Gain control first then decide on method of repair depending on
      patient stability (immediate repair or temporary repair with
      vascular shunt)
    \item
      14 French Argyle vascular shunts can be used on iliac vessels
    \item
      May need to use prosthetic interposition graft due to larger
      caliber of vessels
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Ligation has high morbidity and mortality, should be avoided

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      If external iliac artery is ligated, patient will experience
      proximal limb ischemia and will either need an above knee
      amputation (AKA) or hip disarticulation
    \item
      In life or death situations, ligation and subsequent amputation is
      inevitable to save a patient's life
    \item
      Can consider temporary ligation with return to OR in 2-3 hours to
      re-establish inline flow (consider cross femoral graft) when
      patient is more resuscitated, however, not common in trauma
      situation
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{femoral-vessels}{%
\subsection{Femoral Vessels}\label{femoral-vessels}}

Includes the Common Femoral Artery (CFA), Superficial Femoral Artery
(SFA), and the Deep Femoral (Profunda femoris)

\textbf{Exposure}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Proximal CFA exposure similar to exposure of external iliac (midline
  laparotomy or transplant incision)
\item
  Distal CFA, SFA, and Deep Femoral can be exposed with vertical groin
  incision (below inguinal ligament midway between pubis and ASIS over
  anterior proximal thigh) or oblique groin incision (directly beneath
  inguinal ligament or few centimeters distal)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Repair}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Gain control

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    May be difficult to only use vessel clamps for more proximal
    injuries
  \item
    At common femoral junction, can use Fogarty catheter into orifice of
    deep femoral with balloon inflated to control back bleeding
  \item
    If SFA injured, can clamp distal CFA for control
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Recommend shunt placement
\item
  Repair with primary, patch, or interposition graft (autologous vein
  preferred)
\item
  Ligation also has high morbidity and mortality, should be avoided (see
  iliac section for consequences of ligation and options of shunting)
  (Abou Ali et al. 2017; Subramanian et al. 2008)
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{popliteal-artery}{%
\subsection{Popliteal Artery}\label{popliteal-artery}}

\textbf{Exposure}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Need to gain control of popliteal artery above and below knee

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Above knee popliteal artery is a continuation of the distal SFA
    through the adductor magnus (Hunter's canal)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Position patient in ``frog-leg'' with bump of rolled towels placed
  underneath calf
\item
  Make medial incision from above the knee to mid-thigh

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Locate the distal SFA just at or beyond Hunter's canal in order to
    locate the above knee popliteal artery
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Move bump to above the knee and make a medial incision from below knee
  to mid calf

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Expose the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles and bring down to the
    inferior edge of the tibia to open the below the knee popliteal
    space
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Retraction and good lighting is key

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Can use Weitlaner retractor, Pilling retractor, or Henly popliteal
    retractor to retract muscles and better visualize space
  \item
    Recommend narrow handheld retractor (appendiceal or Wylie renal vein
    retractor) on either the superior or inferior aspect of below or
    above knee incision, respectively, to gain more exposure of the
    popliteal space
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Repair}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Recommend bypass repair (autologous vein preferred if available)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Inflow from distal SFA to distal below knee popliteal target
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Always check repair with intraoperative doppler and check distal flow
  to foot

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    If signal goes down and you are concerned about the technical
    repair, be prepared to re-open and pass thrombectomy catheters
    proximally and distally to evaluate issue
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Even with good technical repair, spasm may occur

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Common among young patients
  \item
    Signal usually improves after re-warming and resuscitation
  \item
    Ensure that there is audible flow in the bypass and patient well
    resuscitated prior to re-opening injury to assess repair
  \item
    On-table angiogram also an option, however, spasm may appear as
    occlusion and repair is unnecessarily re-opened
  \item
    \textbf{Important to note: Water hammer signal is not appropriate
    audible flow as it indicates diastolic flow in the arterial signal}
  \end{itemize}

\hypertarget{tibial-vessels}{%
\subsection{Tibial Vessels}\label{tibial-vessels}}

Repair is selective on extent of injury

Recommend repair if all three tibial vessels are injured and there is no
flow to the foot (anterior tibial, posterior tibial, and peroneal
arteries) (Burkhardt et al. 2010)

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Saphenous vein graft preferred
\end{itemize}

Recommend ligation if one or two tibial vessels injured, as there is
redundant arterial flow to the lower extremity

\subsection{Subclavian and Proximal Axillary
Arteries}\label{subclavian-and-proximal-axillary-arteries}}

\textbf{Important to keep in mind, upper extremity disability can have a
significant impact on quality of life.}

Long term functional impairment is measured by the Disabilities of Arm,
Should, Hand (DASH) questionnaire. Impairment most closely associated
with duration and severity of ischemia and concomitant nerve injury
(36\%). Open reconstruction is preferred and patency rates are
high.(Frech et al. 2016)

Due to protected anatomic location of subclavian vessels, most
subclavian artery trauma is usually cause by penetrating mechanism.

Considered a junctional region for hemorrhage with difficult access for
exposure

Endovascular approach with covered stents may be used in traumatic
axillo-subclavian injuries that are stable enough for intervention
(i.e.~do not require a resuscitative thoracotomy) (Eleftherios S. Xenos
et al. 2003; Branco et al. 2016)

\textbf{Exposure}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Requires thoracotomy or sternotomy associated with clavicular incision
  for access
\item
  Right subclavian/axillary arteries

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Median sternotomy with extension to supraclavicular incision
  \item
    Divide sternocleidomastoid muscle 1 cm above clavicle to expose
    subclavian vein
  \item
    Retract vein and divide anterior scalene muscle to expose subclavian
    artery
  \item
    Careful to locate and avoid phrenic nerve (traverse laterally over
    anterior scalene)
  \item
    Aberrant right subclavian artery directly arises from thoracic aorta
    (0.5-2\%) of population
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Left subclavian/axillary arteries

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Left posterolateral thoracotomy is most optimal, however, requires
    lateral recumbent positioning
  \item
    If patient is requiring midline laparotomy for operative management
    of abdominal trauma, recommend anterolateral thoracotomy in 3rd or
    4th intercostal space

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Extension with supraclavicular incision or median sternotomy to
      better expose proximal subclavian
    \item
      Extension with infraclavicular incision to deltopectoral groove to
      gain access to proximal axillary artery
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Repair}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Primary, patch repair, interposition graft, or bypass dependent on
  extent of injury after debridement to healthy tissue and follows
  tenets of avoiding tension and preserving arterial lumen integrity
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{distal-axillary-and-brachial-arteries}{%
\subsection{Distal Axillary and Brachial
Arteries}\label{distal-axillary-and-brachial-arteries}}

Brachial artery is continuation of distal axillary artery

\textbf{Repair}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Primary Repair can be considered in brachial artery if there is
  redundancy, lack of tension, injury is focal, and no compromise to
  arterial lumen.
\item
  Great saphenous vein preferred over prosthetic for conduit.
\item
  Ligation should be avoided as upper extremity limb ischemia is highly
  disabling and morbid
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{radial-and-ulnar-artery}{%
\subsection{Radial and Ulnar Artery}\label{radial-and-ulnar-artery}}

\textbf{Repair}

  from either the radial or ulnar artery into the distal palmar arch
\item
  If either radial or ulnar injury causes distal hand ischemia, should
  be repaired
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{venous-injury}{%
\section{Venous Injury}\label{venous-injury}}

Venous injuries can be selectively repaired. More proximal venous
injuries should be repaired, while distal injuries can be ligated.

Primary repair with lateral venorrhaphy can be performed due to higher
intrinsic compliance of veins.

\hypertarget{lower-extremity-venous-injury}{%
\subsection{Lower Extremity Venous
Injury}\label{lower-extremity-venous-injury}}

Proximal Vessels (popliteal and femoral veins)

\begin{itemize}

\item
  Repair if patient is stable and not in profound shock

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Can consider venous shunts as well
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Studies confirm that venous repair improves arterial flow in the
  arterial repair since venous outflow is not impeded (Quan et al. 2008;
  Clouse et al. 2007; Todd E. Rasmussen and Tai 2022)
\item
  Even if repair of injured venous vessels thrombose over time,
  thrombosis occurs slowly and does not lead to pulmonary emboli
\end{itemize}

So let's start with an overview of ultrasound modalities, waveforms, and
changes proximal and distal to flow-limiting stenosis.

\hypertarget{sec-lab-overview}{%
\section{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Overview}}{Overview}}\label{sec-lab-overview}}

\textbf{Brief overview of ultrasound:} Ultrasonography uses
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_wave}{sound waves} with
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency}{frequencies} higher than
those audible to humans. Ultrasound images are created by sending pulses
of ultrasound into
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)}{tissue} using a
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound_transducer\#Use_in_medicine}{probe}.
Reflected pulses are recorded and displayed as an image. There are many
types of ultrasound images, but two modes commonly seen in vascular
ultrasonography are B-mode and doppler:

\textbf{B-mode (Brightness) imaging} is a 2-D, black and white display
of tissue
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_impedance}{acoustic
impedance}s.

\textbf{Doppler mode} uses the Doppler effect to measure and visualize
blood flow.

\textbf{Spectral Doppler} converts frequency shifts from moving blood to
velocities using the Doppler equation and displays a ``spectrum'' of
these frequencies as Doppler waveforms.

\textbf{Color Doppler} presents velocity information as a color-coded
overlay on top of a B-mode image. Duplex ultrasonography is a term
commonly used for the simultaneous presentation of B-mode and doppler
data. Of note, when looking at a still image of a color flow duplex, the
color may be misleading for direction because it may not be noted at
which part of the cardiac cycle the picture was taken. It is far more
reliable to look at the spectral doppler waveform.

\textbf{Power Doppler} is less frequently used, but is based solely on
amplitude of the doppler signal without giving information on direction.
This is particularly useful to detect certain low or abnormal flow
states, such as testicular/ovarian torsion, carotid string sign, slow
intrarenal flow, supporting occlusion seen on B-mode or color.(Pellerito
and Polak 2019)

\hypertarget{waveforms}{%
\subsection{Waveforms}\label{waveforms}}

\textbf{What do normal spectral waveforms look like?}

\ul{Normal spectral waveforms} have a brisk upstroke, sharp peak, rapid
downstroke. A ``spectral window'' under the waveform, that is the black
space between the spectral waveform and the 0 velocity axis, represents
the absence of lower velocities - indicative of laminar flow within the
vessel (Image 1: normal spectrum waveform)

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{images/vasc_lab2/Slide2.png}

}

\end{figure}

\textbf{How can we differentiate low vs high resistance waveforms?}

Waveform profiles change depending upon the nature of the distal
vascular bed being supplied. Organs like the brain, kidneys, liver,
spleen, peripheral muscle during exercise, and postprandial SMA have
constant high metabolic demand, and are therefore low resistance
vascular beds. \ul{Low resistance waveforms} for arteries supplying
these organs demonstrate constant forward flow throughout the cardiac
cycle because the distal bed being supplied has low resistance leading
to high end-diastolic flow.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{images/vasc_lab2/Slide3.png}

}

\end{figure}

In contrast, \ul{high resistance waveforms} are seen for arteries
supplying resting peripheral muscles, fasted mesenteric beds (such as
the fasting SMA), and the external carotid artery. High resistance
waveforms are characterized by triphasic morphology, with a sharp peak,
early diastolic flow reversal, brief forward flow (elastic recoil of the
artery, and then no flow during the remainder of the diastolic phase.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{images/vasc_lab2/Slide4.png}

}

\end{figure}

\textbf{How does flow-limiting stenosis change the waveform?}

First let's define \ul{Stenosis:} A hemodynamically significant stenosis
(area reduction \textgreater50\%) will result in a doubling of velocity
from the inflow segment to the area of maximal stenosis (velocity ratio
\textgreater2).

\textbf{Now what do waveforms look like AFTER a flow-limiting stenosis?}

\ul{Tardus et parvus} refers to a pattern of Doppler ultrasound spectral
waveform resulting from arterial stenosis. The tardus et parvus waveform
is delayed with prolonged systolic acceleration (tardus) and diminished
with a small systolic amplitude and rounded systolic peak (parvus). This
phenomenon is observed downstream from the site of stenosis. Tardus
parvus in the CFA represents upstream (iliac) stenosis. Tardus parvus in
the brachial artery likely represents upstream (subclavian or axillary)
stenosis.(Hwang 2017; Pellerito and Polak 2019)

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{images/vasc_lab2/Slide5.png}

}

\end{figure}

\textbf{So what will the waveform look like BEFORE a flow-limiting
stenosis?}

\ul{Distal stenosis:} Distal occlusive disease will result in a high
resistance waveform, with absent diastolic flow. (Image 5: Distal
stenosis with absent diastolic flow)

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{images/vasc_lab2/Slide6.png}

}

\end{figure}

\textbf{Are there any considerations we need to understand when
assessing a stented vessel with ultrasound?}

Stenting decreases vessel compliance and increases observed velocities.
There is no defined consensus, but \ul{in-stent restenosis} is
classified by some as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textgreater50\%

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    SFA - Vr \textgreater1.5 or PSV \textgreater200 (Baril et al. 2009;
    Kawarada et al. 2013)
  \item
    ICA - ICA/CCA \textgreater2.7 and PSV \textgreater220.(Lal et al.
    2008)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textgreater80\%

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    SFA - Vr \textgreater{} 3.5 or PSV \textgreater275 (Baril et al.
    2009; Kawarada et al. 2013)
  \item
    ICA - ICA/CCA \textgreater{} 4.15 and PSV \textgreater{} 340.(Lal et
    al. 2008)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

It should be noted that restenosis of stents vs vein grafts in the lower
extremity will have higher velocity for the same percentage of stenosis.
Tardus et parvus waveforms distal to a stent should raise concern that
stenosis is hemodynamically significant.(Baril et al. 2009; Kawarada et
al. 2013)

\textbf{Ultrasound compared to other diagnostic modalities}

Duplex is often adequate to visualize any peripheral arterial bed, even
the aorta and iliacs.(Muela Méndez et al. 2018)

\begin{itemize}
\item
  CT - limitations include ionizing radiation, iodinated contrast and is
  not appropriate in patients with CKD.
\item
  MRA - is performed with gadolinium-based contrast and is not
  appropriate in patients with ESRD.
\end{itemize}

Now that we've covered the basics, let's move through by organ-system
high-yield vascular lab studies, findings, and pathologies. We'll start
with the extracranial evaluation, a highly-tested area of vascular
ultrasonography.

\hypertarget{sec-extracranial}{%
\section{Extracranial}\label{sec-extracranial}}

\textbf{What does a typical extracranial evaluation involve?}

Examine CCA (2 views), ICA (2 views), ECA, vertebral arteries

\textbf{What are normal ICA and ECA waveforms?}

\ul{Normal ECA vs ICA waveform:} The external carotid artery waveform
reflects a high resistance vascular bed. This means minimal diastolic
flow. Conversely, the ICA waveform reflects a low resistance vascular
bed with antegrade diastolic flow.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{images/vasc_lab2/Slide7.png}

}

\end{figure}

This makes sense, as the ICA is supplying the brain while the ECA is
supplying the face. Intuitively, the common carotid artery is a mixture
of the ICA and ECA waveform morphologies - like the ICA with forward
flow throughout diastole, but less as compared to the ICA due to the
high-resistance influence of the ECA.

Another way of differentiating the external and internal carotid
arteries is the ``temporal tap''. Tapping on the superficial temporal
artery (a branch of the ECA) will be transmitted as small pulsations in
the diastolic component of the external carotid artery.(Pellerito and
Polak 2019; Size et al. 2013)

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{images/vasc_lab2/Slide8.png}

}

\end{figure}

\textbf{Can you talk about diagnostic criteria for ICA stenosis?}

\ul{Parameters for ICA stenosis}: These are a few numbers that are
(unfortunately) essential to memorize for the VSITE and RPVI.

Although criteria differ between guidelines, the Carotid Consensus
Criteria, define ICA stenosis \textgreater= 70\% as a peak systolic
velocity \textgreater= 230 cm/sec, EDV \textgreater{} 100 cm/sec, and
ICA/CCA ratio \textgreater{} 4.0. Of note, post-stenting criteria vary
from pre-stenting criteria. Stenosis criteria are not clearly defined
for the CCA or ECA.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{images/vasc_lab2/Slide9.png}

}

\end{figure}

\textbf{When is surgery indicated for ICA stenosis?}

\ul{Parameters for when surgery indicated:}

Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study (ACAS) \textgreater60\%
stenosis asymptomatic, NASCET \textgreater50\% stenosis symptomatic

For more see Chapter~\ref{sec-cerebrovascular}.

\textbf{Let's talk about other pathologies that can be visualized on
extracranial ultrasound:}

\ul{Pathologies:} Stenosis (plaque), dissection (flap), aneurysms
(rare), occlusion (no flow, do not operate), carotid body tumor
(splaying of ECA/ICA, fed by ECA branches), FMD.

FMD is frequently encountered on the VSITE/RPVI. How would this appear
on the exams?

\ul{Fibromuscular dysplasia} of the internal carotid arteries affects
women more commonly than men. Duplex findings show a ``chain of lakes''
appearance, demonstrative of multiple septa and small aneurysms.
Velocity elevations and increased turbulence in the waveform patterns is
typically found on Doppler interrogation.(Jeffrey W. Olin et al. 2012)

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{images/vasc_lab2/Slide10.png}

}

\end{figure}

\ul{Aortic stenosis:} Tardus parvus waveforms in both common carotid
arteries can be a sign of more proximal disease of the aortic valve or
global myocardial dysfunction.

\textbf{How to treat?}

Aspirin if asymptomatic, POBA if symptomatic.

\textbf{Are there other frequently tested pathologies demonstrated on
extracranial exam?}

\ul{Subclavian steal:} Subclavian steal occurs when a proximal
subclavian stenosis or occlusion leads to reversal of vertebral artery
flow. This causes ``stealing'' of blood from the posterior cerebral
circulation, and presents as vertebrobasilar insufficiency.

\textbf{How does this look on duplex?}

Normal vertebral flow looks very similar to ICA: antegrade low
resistance waveforms with constant forward flow throughout the cardiac
cycle. As subclavian stenosis progresses, one can see mid-systolic
velocity deceleration ('bunny ears''), with mild stenosis bidirectional
flow can signify ``pre-steal'' phenomena, and with severe steal, there
is a complete reversal of flow in the vertebral artery towards the arm
rather than towards the brain.(Kalaria et al. 2005; Mousa et al. 2017)

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{images/vasc_lab2/Slide11.png}

}

\end{figure}

\ul{Innominate stenosis:} A phenomenon that is related to this, is
innominate stenosis. Here again the patient will present with
vertebrobasilar insufficiency, indicative of diminished vertebral
antegrade flow, but additionally will experience right hemispheric
insufficiency secondary to diminished R ICA antegrade flow. The
right-side duplex will demonstrate flow reversal in the vertebral
artery, abnormal waveforms in the subclavian, as well as steal pattern
waveforms in the common and internal carotid arteries. The common
denominator for all of these findings is significant disease in the
innominate artery.

\textbf{What other extracranial arteries of the head and neck can be
evaluated separately?}

\ul{Temporal arteritis} - well visualized with high frequency transducer
(10 MHz or greater). Pathognomonic halo effect of anechoic/hypoechoic
edematous tissue surrounding the lumen due to concentric
inflammation.(Ball et al. 2010; W. A. Schmidt 2014)

\hypertarget{sec-intracranial}{%
\section{Intracranial}\label{sec-intracranial}}

\textbf{So that covers extracranial vascular lab evaluation. What about
intracranial?}

This is less frequently tested, so we will discuss just a brief overview
of views and some of the more commonly tested pathologies related to
transcranial doppler (TCD).

\ul{\textbf{Intracranial}} \textbf{-} Arteries differentiated by depth.
MCA 3-6 cm, everything else deeper. Three primary views:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Temporal view:} Used to interrogate PCA, ACA, MCA, and ICA.
  The MCA, ICA and PCA flow direction is towards the probe, the ACA flow
  direction is away.
\item
  \textbf{Occipital (Foraminal) view:} Basilar and vertebral arteries
  (both away).
\item
  \textbf{Orbital view:} Ophthalmic and ICA
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What are some frequently tested pathologies that are identified
on TCD?}

Indications often tested:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \ul{MCA spasm (severe PSV\textgreater200)}: Can be seen in sickle cell
  disease with studies indicating a strong correlation between mean
  velocities of \textgreater200cm/s and the rate of stroke in children
  with sickle cell disease. With blood transfusions, stroke risk can be
  reduced from \textgreater10\% to \textless1\% per year. (Bulas et al.
  2000)

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Lindegrad ratio is the MCA velocity divided by the distal ICA
    velocity and can also be used to assess MCA spasm.

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Ratio of 3-6 is indicative of mild-mod vasospasm.
    \item
      \textgreater6 is severe vasospasm.
    \item
      \textless3 is a sign of hyperemia.(Kirsch et al. 2013)
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \ul{Cerebral ischemia during CEA:} Comparing transcranial Doppler
  sonography, near-infrared spectroscopy, stump pressure measurement,
  and somatosensory evoked potentials, cerebral ischemia was most
  accurately predicted by the percent change in transcranial Doppler
  detected middle cerebral artery velocity. Detection of a greater than
  50\% drop in middle cerebral artery velocity using transcranial
  Doppler is 100\% sensitive for detecting cerebral ischemia.(Moritz et
  al. 2007a)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    TCD can also demonstrate microemboli (high spikes of white vertical
    lines on spectral doppler) during CEA.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  A shower of bubbles in both cerebral hemispheres upon injection with
  agitated saline is consistent with a R to L cardiac shunt and patent
  foramen ovale.(Zito et al. 2009)
\item
  Elevated contralateral ICA velocities can demonstrate compensatory
  flow and collateralization and can be a sign of persistent MCA
  occlusion.
\item
  Mechanical Compression of the vertebral arteries: TCD will show normal
  posterior circulation velocities at rest, disappearance of waveform on
  provocative maneuvers, and increase in velocity once back in a neutral
  position representing a reactive hyperemia.(Vilela et al. 2005)
\item
  Vasomotor activity can be evaluated as well with TCD. Hypercapnia or
  breath-holding should result in vasodilation and increased flow.
  Hypocapnia will result in decreased flow. No change in response to
  hyper or hypocapnia can show poor cerebral autoregulation.(M. Müller
  et al. 1995)
\item
  Reversal of flow in the ophthalmic artery can be a sign of ipsilateral
  ICA occlusion.(Guan et al. 2013)
\item
  Brain death determination - In patients with cerebral arrest (brain
  death) TCD will demonstrate a low amplitude, high-resistance waveform
  with to and fro flow with zero net flow.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{upper-extremity-2}{%
\section{Upper Extremity}\label{upper-extremity-2}}

Having covered head and neck vasculature, let's move on to peripheral
vasculature. This is a huge area both on the VSITE/RPVI and in practice.
In this section we'll cover first the upper, then the lower extremity
vasculature.

\textbf{So first, what are characteristics of waveforms in the
peripheral vasculature?}

\ul{Peripheral}: Normal waveforms are indicative of high resistance
distal beds, so we would expect triphasic waveforms

\textbf{What are normal arterial parameters in the upper extremities?}

Normal pressure gradient between the right and left brachial pressures
is \textless20 mmHg. Normal finger pressure is \textgreater80\% of the
ipsilateral brachial systolic pressure. Digital brachial index
\textless0.8 is abnormal and \textless0.5 is diagnostic of ischemia.
Absolute digital pressure \textless70mmHg is abnormal and
\textless60mmHg is diagnostic for ischemia. A gradient between digits of
\textgreater15 mmHg is considered abnormal. These criteria are used in
occlusive disease and steal syndrome.(Chloros et al. 2008; Sen and
Tripathi 2016)

\textbf{Let's talk about some of the most frequently tested pathologies,
starting with arterial TOS.}

\ul{Arterial TOS:} Results from compression of the subclavian artery at
the level of the first rib within the scalene triangle. Arterial TOS
testing is done by placing a sensor, most often photoplethysmography
(PPG), on one finger of each hand, recording the resting waveforms and
then recording while during maneuvers to evoke arterial compression in
the thoracic outlet.(Size et al. 2013)

\textbf{Can you tell us a little more about PPG testing?}

\ul{Photoplethysmography (PPG)} uses an infrared light to illuminate
superficial tissue. The reflection is received by a photosensor, and
amplitude of the reflected light is proportional to the volume of red
blood cells in the sample area. A normal digital arterial PPG has a
brisk upstroke with a narrow systolic peak, and a dicrotic notch on the
downslope during diastole.(Carter and Tate 2001)

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{images/vasc_lab2/Slide12.png}

}

\end{figure}

Digital PPGs change with progression of peripheral vascular disease. The
first changes are a loss of amplitude and loss of the dicrotic notch.
More advanced disease~findings include a flattened systolic peak and a
prolonged upstroke. Significant arterial TOS is suggested when there is
a loss or persistent flattening of the digit waveforms during any of the
positional changes that can compress the subclavian artery (either with
the clavicle, first rib and scalene muscle). However, it should be noted
that up to one-third of patients without arterial TOS may have some
degree of subclavian artery compression with positional maneuvers.

\textbf{What are other diseases affecting the upper extremity?}

\ul{Raynaud's:} Vasospastic disorder characterized by temporary
vasospasm. Diagnosis may be assisted by decrease in digital waveforms
with immersion of the hand in cold water.

\ul{Thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's Disease):} Is a segmental
non-atherosclerotic inflammatory disorder characterized by
microthrombosis that primarily involves the small- and medium-sized
arteries. Ultrasonography may demonstrate the classical ``corkscrew''
collateral development at the level of occlusion. TA has a male
predominance and first-line treatment is smoking cessation.

\hypertarget{hemodialysis-access}{%
\subsection{Hemodialysis Access}\label{hemodialysis-access}}

Before we segue to the lower extremities, this is a good time to discuss
an entity frequently tested on the VSITE that constitutes for many
vascular surgeons a notable portion of their practice: hemodialysis
access, and specifically fistulas.

\ul{Fistulas}: Ultrasound is one of the key modalities used in
identifying suitable anatomy for fistula placement, suitability of a
fistula for dialysis, and finally complications of fistulas.

\textbf{So first, assessment for fistula placement:}

The optimal configuration for an AVF is determined on the basis of vein
mapping and noninvasive studies. Veins should measure \textgreater3 mm
in diameter (\textgreater2.5 mm may be acceptable, as veins are likely
to dilate under anesthesia), and there should be no venous outflow
stenosis or arterial inflow stenosis.

Loss of phasic variation in the upper extremity veins may indicate
central stenosis and that extremity may not be appropriate for access
creation.(Y. C. Kim et al. 2009; Lok et al. 2020) Duplex ultrasound
arterial imaging can be performed at the same time as vein mapping and
can provide important predictors of fistula maturation, such as arterial
diameter and flow. The minimal arterial lumen diameter is 2 mm.

\textbf{How can we tell if a fistula is ready to be used for
hemodialysis access?}

Rule of 6's: At six weeks post-creation the diameter of the fistula
should be at least 6 mm and the depth no more than 0.6 cm. The flow rate
should be at least 600ml/min, and the length of the fistula should be 6
cm to allow for a successful two-needle dialysis.

Brachial artery volume flow rate (VFR) is one of the best measurements
to identify poor fistula maturation. \textgreater800 ml/min is ideal,
but \textgreater600 is often sufficient.(Ko et al. 2015) To determine
the volume flow (VF) the sample volume (SV) should be opened wall to
wall in a segment of fistula that is straight with a constant diameter
and include all velocities present within the fistula. Angle correction
should be less than 60 degrees.(Gerrickens et al. 2018; Ko et al. 2015)

\textbf{What do normal fistula spectral waveforms look like?}

\ul{Waveform:} The arterial waveform should demonstrate very low
resistance throughout diastole. End diastolic velocity should be one
half to two thirds of peak systolic velocity in a well-functioning
fistula. As a side note, this is also what one would see in an
iatrogenic arteriovenous fistula, as between the femoral artery and
vein.(Teodorescu, Gustavson, and Schanzer 2012)

\textbf{Let's discuss commonly encountered complications and pathologies
identified in association with fistulas:}

\ul{Pseudoaneurysms:} Pseudoaneurysms commonly occur when a puncture
fails to seal and the blood is contained by the surrounding soft tissue.
As in other locations, pseudoaneurysms are defined on imaging by a
communicating neck between the arterial vessel and pseudoaneurysmal sac
with ``to-and-fro'' waveform at duplex.(Mahmoud et al. 2015) While small
pseudoaneurysms can be managed without intervention or surgery, larger
pseudoaneurysms, pseudoaneurysms associated with infection or overlying
skin changes or bleeding may require excision and repair.(Dennis F.
Bandyk 2013)

\ul{Steal syndrome:} Hemodialysis-related steal, also known as
access-related hand ischemia, which may occur in over half of all
patients undergoing access creation. Steal is characterized by
retrograde diastolic flow distal to the donor artery. Of note, reversal
of flow in and of itself is not sufficient to cause distal ischemia with
an intact palmar arch. This is commonly seen after access creation and
represents physiologic steal phenomenon, rather than symptomatic steal
syndrome. Digital pressures \textless60 mm Hg are highly sensitive and
specific for predicting steal. Patients who have no symptoms (Grade 1
access-related hand ischemia), may be closely monitored without any
intervention.

\textbf{How do we treat more severe steal?}

Flow rate measurements of the fistula can help determine the optimal
treatment (banding, revision using distal inflow, distal
revascularization with interval ligation, proximalization of arterial
inflow or ligation of the fistula). For more on steal, see
Section~\ref{sec-steal-syndrome}

\textbf{So steal can occur in the context of high fistula output, can we
talk a bit about low fistula flow, as from stenosis?}

\ul{Central venous stenosis:} Venous outflow stenosis is the most common
reason for arteriovenous graft failure. A low flow rate results in
recirculation during the dialysis session. Venous obstruction manifests
as arm swelling, and with central venous stenosis may present with
collateral development over the upper extremity and chest wall.

\ul{Stenosis of fistula:} Arterial and mid-graft stenosis can also cause
complications, but are less common than venous stenosis. Stenosis on
imaging will be represented by narrowing of luminal diameter of 50\%
(which correlates to a 75\% reduction in cross-sectional area) on b-mode
ultrasound, PSV\textgreater400, Vr \textgreater2.5, high-resistance
waveform proximal to the stenosis, and tardus parvus waveform distal to
the stenosis.(Dennis F. Bandyk 2013)

\hypertarget{sec-lab-lower-extremity}{%
\section{Lower Extremity}\label{sec-lab-lower-extremity}}

\textbf{Can you please tell us about some of the diagnostic modalities
that are used to examine perfusion in the lower extremities?}

\ul{ABIs:} Ankle-brachial index measurement requires calculating the
ratio of the highest ankle systolic pressure (posterior tibial artery or
dorsalis pedis) over the highest brachial systolic pressure. Regardless
of whether you're doing the R or L ABI, use the higher arm pressure for
both ratios. Normal ABI \textgreater0.9, severe disease indicated by
ABI\textless0.5, and CLI by ABI\textless0.3.

The ankle-brachial index in diabetic patients is frequently unreliable
due to incompressibility of the tibial vessels at the level of the cuff
secondary to calcification. Consequently, toe pressures are mandatory in
all patients with diabetes mellitus. Normal TBI\textgreater0.7.

Of note, monophasic waveforms in the brachial artery likely represent
proximal occlusive disease in the upper extremity and therefore make the
ABI non-diagnostic because the upper extremity blood pressure is not
likely not representative of central blood pressure.(A. Chen, Prout, and
Jain 2014)

\ul{TcPO2:} When there is significant tissue loss, preventing TBI
measurement, another option is transcutaneous oximetry (TcPO2).(Mills et
al. 2014b) Transcutaneous oximetry is a non-invasive method of measuring
the tissue partial pressure of oxygen through a heated sensor on the
skin. A TcPO2 value of 40 mmHg is the critical value below which wound
healing is impaired and ischemia develops.

\textbf{Are there other non-invasive ways of determining extremity
perfusion?}

\ul{PVRs:} Pulse volume recordings. Normal PVR waveforms have a rapid
upstroke, sharp peak, prominent dicrotic notch and downslope. This
typically uses 4 cuffs. High thigh cuff should be 30\% greater than
brachial pressure, hence a thigh-brachial index of 1.3 is normal.
However, ABI/PVRs may not demonstrate significantly abnormal
values/waveforms in individuals with single level disease.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{images/vasc_lab2/Slide13.png}

}

\end{figure}

\ul{Exercise Test:} During exercise testing, patients are placed on a
treadmill after baseline resting ABIs are measured. The patient is then
asked to walk for 5 minutes or until physical discomfort requires test
cessation. The point when the patient reports pain starts is the initial
claudication distance and the point where the patient stops is defined
as the absolute claudication distance. Diagnostic criteria for a
positive test include a drop-in ankle pressure of greater than 20 mmHg
from baseline, drop in ABI greater than 0.2 from baseline, or inability
of ankle pressures to return to baseline after 3 minutes.(Strandness and
Bell 1964)

\textbf{So just to briefly summarize, what are parameters associated
with poor wound healing?}

\ul{Parameters associated with poor wound healing:} Considering these
various testing modalities, what are factors associated with poor
likelihood of wound healing? An ankle pressure \textless50 mmHg, ABI
\textless{} 0.40, TcPO2 \textless20 mmHg, or a toe pressure \textless20
mmHg are considered predictive of non-healing.

\textbf{What is the utility of duplex in diagnosing lower extremity
occlusive disease?}

Duplex ultrasound is utilized to further delineate the anatomy, level
and severity of occlusive disease. Increased PSV can identify the site
of a hemodynamically significant stenosis. Diminished waveforms often
suggest more proximal disease.

Of note, diffuse narrowing of the SFA can result in tardus et parvus
waveforms in the popliteal, without necessarily demonstrating any areas
of high velocity.(Aburahma and Perler 2022; Pellerito and Polak 2019)

While duplex ultrasound most easily visualizes infrainguinal arterial
disease, it can also be used to evaluate for iliac artery stenosis.
Patients with an iliac Vr\textgreater2.5 or monophasic/biphasic
waveforms in the CFA, suggest that further imaging of the iliac system
may be required.(Heinen et al. 2018)

\textbf{Ultrasound is frequently used for graft surveillance. Can you
talk about graft surveillance parameters?}

Suggested bypass vein graft surveillance with ABI, clinical exam and
duplex should begin immediately after surgery and then continues at 3,
6, and 12 months and then every 6 to 12 months thereafter.(Conte et al.
2006; Zierler et al. 2018) A velocity ratio (Vr) is often utilized in
graft surveillance and is defined as the peak systolic velocity (PSV) at
the site of a stenosis divided by the PSV in a normal vessel segment
proximal to the stenosis.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The highest risk for graft thrombosis, and highest cause for concern,
  is suggested by PSV \textgreater300 cm/s, Vr \textgreater3.5, a
  mid-graft flow velocity \textless45 cm/s or a drop in ABI
  \textgreater0.15. (Dennis F. Bandyk et al. 1988; Zierler et al. 2018)
\item
  Increased risk grafts have a PSV 180-300 cm/s and a Vr 2.0-3.5.
\item
  Spectral pulse wave doppler is more sensitive than color doppler to
  identify low flow states or thrombosed grafts.(Hedrick, Hykes, and
  Starchman 2005)
\item
  Criteria for prosthetic grafts is higher than vein bypass. (Zierler et
  al. 2018)
\end{itemize}

Intervention for recurrent vein bypass graft stenosis early after
angioplasty may be best treated with an open revision and patch
plasty.(Jongsma et al. 2016)

Presenting with new swelling, pain and fluid around a prosthetic graft
on duplex ultrasound may be a sign of underlying graft infection. PET
and WBC scans may be positive up to 4 months after implantation, so do
not provide much utility in the early post-operative period.(Puges et
al. 2019)

\hypertarget{pathologies}{%
\subsection{Pathologies}\label{pathologies}}

\textbf{Let's talk about pathologies frequently encountered in the lower
extremities:}

\hypertarget{sec-lab-psa}{%
\subsubsection{Pseudoaneurysms (particularly
femoral)}\label{sec-lab-psa}}

Gray-scale ultrasonography demonstrates a hypoechoic cystic structure
adjacent to an arterial supply. Color Doppler typically demonstrates a
``yin-yang sign'' within the pseudoaneurysm sac. The hallmark ultrasound
sign is identification of a neck between the sac and the feeding artery
with a ``to-and-fro'' spectral Doppler waveform measured at the neck.
This represents the flow in and out of the PSA during systole and
diastole.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{images/vasc_lab2/Slide14.png}

}

\end{figure}

Anastomotic pseudoaneurysms develop in around 3\% of femoral anastomoses
and can be associated with arterial wall weakness, endarterectomy,
mismatch between artery/graft, dilation/deterioration of graft material,
increased/uneven tension of the anastomosis, or underlying
infection.(Pellerito and Polak 2019)

\hypertarget{dissections}{%
\subsubsection{Dissections}\label{dissections}}

Characteristic ultrasound findings on color Doppler include a parallel
blood-flow channel that separates the true and false lumen, with
diminished blood flow distally.(Ge et al. 2015; N. Kobayashi et al.
2018) Traumatic intimal flaps after knee dislocation can have a normal
ABI and be asymptomatic, but they should be followed as they can
progress.(Gaitini et al. 2008) Of note, if the false lumen is filled by
a thrombus, it may not distinguishable from an intramural hematoma or
non-calcified plaque.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{images/vasc_lab2/Slide15.png}

}

\end{figure}

\hypertarget{sec-lab-buerger}{%
\subsubsection{Buerger's Disease}\label{sec-lab-buerger}}

Also known as thromboangiitis obliterans, this is a rare disease, but
with characteristic findings on ultrasound of serpiginous/corkscrew
collaterals, occlusion of distal calf/pedal arteries, and normal
proximal arteries.(K. Busch 2011; Fujii et al. 2011)

For more see Section~\ref{sec-buergers-disease}

\textbf{There are several disease pathologies that are frequently tested
relating to the popliteal fossa. Can you talk briefly about these?}

\hypertarget{sec-lab-cystic-adventitial-disease}{%
\subsubsection{Cystic Adventitial
Disease}\label{sec-lab-cystic-adventitial-disease}}

This is a rare (but often tested) pathology. Adventitial cystic disease
is a non-atherosclerotic etiology of claudication, most often affecting
the popliteal artery in the lower extremity and leading to stenosis or
occlusion. Duplex imaging of the popliteal artery will demonstrate an
anechoic or hypoechoic \emph{intraluminal} region with a smooth contour
and stenosis documented by velocity increase on spectral doppler.
Angiography will often show a classic ``scimitar'' sign - a smooth
well-defined crescent-shaped defect.(M. Shaw et al. 2007; Winn et al.
2015)

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{images/vasc_lab2/Slide16.png}

\end{figure}

For more on adventitial cystic disease, see
Section~\ref{sec-cystic-adventitial-disease}. This is not to be confused
with:

\hypertarget{bakers-cyst}{%
\subsubsection{Bakers Cyst}\label{bakers-cyst}}

A benign, cystic structure found in the popliteal fossa and arising from
the joint capsule. Flexion of the knee may result in compression of the
popliteal artery by the cyst. On b-mode ultrasound, a well-defined,
anechoic cystic structure with a `neck' extending into the joint space
between the semimembranosus tendon and the medial head of the
gastrocnemius will be identified.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{images/vasc_lab2/Slide17.png}

\end{figure}

\ul{Popliteal entrapment syndrome:} decrease in ABI or loss of distal
pulses with passive dorsiflexion or active plantar flexion of the foot
caused by compression of the popliteal artery by the gastrocnemius.

\hypertarget{abdominal}{%
\section{Abdominal}\label{abdominal}}

Lowest frequency transducers (2-4MHz) are used for imaging abdominal
vessels.

\hypertarget{sec-lab-aorta}{%
\subsection{Aorta}\label{sec-lab-aorta}}

\textbf{Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms (AAA):} Ultrasound screening of a AAA
is non-invasive, accurate, and cost-effective.(Chaikof, Dalman,
Eskandari, Jackson, Lee, Mansour, Mastracci, Mell, Murad, Nguyen, and
al. 2018)

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Sensitivity of 98\% and specificity of 99\% for AAA diagnosis.(Wilmink
  et al. 2002)
\item
  Aneurysm is measured in transverse view, anterior to posterior
  diameter, outer wall to outer wall.(IAC 2021) Size criteria for AAA
  repair is 5.5 cm men, 5.0-5.5 cm in women.
\item
  Can be limited by bowel gas or obesity - so recommend fasting.
\item
  For more details, see Chapter~\ref{sec-abd-aneurysms}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Can ultrasound be used for graft surveillance s/p EVAR?}

Surveillance color duplex ultrasound is safe if CT imaging at 1 year
exhibits no sac growth, graft migration, or endoleak (or stable type II
endoleak). Contrast enhanced duplex, in particular, has a high
sensitivity and specificity to detect endoleaks.(Abraha et al. 2017;
Kapetanios et al. 2019; Chaer et al. 2009)

Type II endoleak classification is subdivided on surveillance duplex.
Type IIa has a single inflow vessel and a ``to-and-fro'' appearance,
whereas Type IIb has multiple vessels and maintains a monophasic flow.
Type IIa endoleaks with velocities greater than 100cm/sec are not likely
to spontaneously resolve and may be resistant to therapy.(Arko et al.
2003; Marrewijk et al. 2004)

Type II endoleaks with stable sac size can continue surveillance with
color duplex.(Chaikof, Dalman, Eskandari, Jackson, Lee, Mansour,
Mastracci, Mell, Murad, Nguyen, and al. 2018; Karthikesalingam et al.
2012; Chaer et al. 2009) Any findings concerning for growth, endoleak or
flow in the sac should have confirmatory CTA performed.(Maleux et al.
2017)

Surveillance duplex does not reliably detect graft migration given
challenge of renal arteries visualization in a long axis view of the
aorta.(K. J. Busch et al. 2009)

Velocities within stents are elevated from baseline due to stent
rigidity, but a limb velocity \textgreater300cm/s with a Vr
\textgreater3.5 is associated with a high risk of limb occlusion from
stenosis or kinking and should undergo further investigation or
intervention.(Chaikof, Dalman, Eskandari, Jackson, Lee, Mansour,
Mastracci, Mell, Murad, Nguyen, and al. 2018; Blom et al. 2012)

\textbf{What other pathologies can be identified on ultrasound
evaluation of the abdomen?}

\ul{CIA aneurysms:} SVS defines CIA aneurysms as any permanent,
localized dilatation of the iliac artery \textgreater1.5 cm in diameter
(diameter 1.5x the normal diameter)

\ul{Para-anastomotic pseudoaneurysms:} As previously discussed (reported
in up to 0.5\% to 10\% of cases)

\ul{Penetrating aortic ulcers:} Describes an ulcerating atherosclerotic
lesion that penetrates the intima and progresses into the media.
Associated with atherosclerotic plaque on ultrasound

\ul{Dissections:} (as already discussed) a dissection flap is usually
identified and color flow demonstrates dual channels (true and false
lumens). Turbulent flow patterns are frequently encountered.

\hypertarget{mesenteric-vasculature}{%
\subsection{Mesenteric Vasculature}\label{mesenteric-vasculature}}

\textbf{So far we have steered clear of the mesenteric vasculature. But
this is an area frequently encountered on exams. Let's start with
mesenteric vessel stenosis.}

\textbf{Celiac and SMA stenosis:} May present as chronic mesenteric
ischemia. PSV \textgreater275 cm/s in the SMA or \textgreater200 cm/s in
the celiac artery indicates \textgreater=70\% stenosis. Normal SMA
Doppler waveforms in the fasting patient show high resistance waveform,
PSV \textless275 cm/s and no spectral broadening. In the postprandial
state, the waveform becomes low resistance, with a slightly increased
PSV and little to no spectral broadening. Significant SMA stenosis may
be differentiated by the presence of spectral broadening and elevated
PSV (\textgreater275cm/s) and EDV (\textgreater55cm/s).(AbuRahma et al.
2012; Gustavo S. Oderich and Ribeiro 2019b) Distal to the stenosis, one
would expect a tardus parvus waveform. EDV \textgreater45 in SMA or
\textgreater55 in celiac are predictive of stenosis (would expect higher
diastolic flow in celiac trunk given low resistance vascular bed of
liver and spleen).

Reversal of flow in the hepatic artery and mildly elevated SMA
velocities may indirectly signify severe stenosis or occlusion of the
celiac artery.

Note that aberrant anatomy with the hepatic artery arising from the SMA,
will result in the proximal SMA demonstrating a low resistance waveform,
even in the fasted state.(Pellerito and Polak 2019)

Mesenteric duplex is still valid even if the patient has not fasted. The
images may be technically more difficult to acquire due to bowel gas,
however if velocities can be obtained, you are likely to see elevated
PSV and low resistance waveform in the SMA. The EDV will also be
elevated and should be interpreted with caution.

\textbf{IMA Stenosis:} PSV \textgreater200 cm/s or aortic ratio
\textgreater2.5 has a high sensitivity for hemodynamically significant
stenosis. However, this is rarely clinically significant and does not
require treatment.

\textbf{What other mesenteric vessel pathologies may be identified on
vascular ultrasound?}

\ul{Dissections:} Rare without concomitant aortic dissection, describe
only in case reports.(Gouëffic et al. 2002; Oglesby and Sorrell 2006)

\ul{Aneurysms:} Rare. Repair \textgreater2 cm celiac, hepatic, SMA
aneurysms and \textgreater3 cm splenic and renal.

\ul{Median arcuate ligament syndrome:} MALS can cause significantly
elevated velocities at the origin of the celiac artery. Testing is for
reversible mechanical compression, as opposed to a fixed lesion from
atherosclerotic disease. During deep inspiration or in the upright
position the MAL is elevated and celiac velocities should normalize if
stenosis is secondary to MALS.(Tembey et al. 2015)

\ul{Hepatic artery thrombosis:} Mesenteric duplex is often performed in
liver transplant patients. Hepatic artery thrombosis most often occurs
within the first 30 days after liver transplantation, with an incidence
of 1.5-9\% and a mortality rate of 75\%.(García-Criado et al. 2009;
Sanyal et al. 2012)

\hypertarget{portal-vein}{%
\subsection{Portal Vein}\label{portal-vein}}

\textbf{So I recognize that we are jumping ahead here discussing venous
circulation, but as this represents another component of a mesenteric
vascular exam, let's discuss portal venous ultrasonography.}

Normal portal venous flow is hepatopetal (toward the liver), whereas
abnormal portal venous flow is hepatofugal (away from the liver). (The
root ``fugua'' means to flee, or flight). Flow should be in the same
direction as the hepatic artery.

Other abnormalities that may be visualized are portal vein thrombosis -
often associated with portal venous hypertension in patients with
chronic cirrhosis, hepatitis, or hepatocellular carcinoma. Acute portal
vein thrombosis on ultrasound demonstrates dilatation of the portal vein
with hypoechoic intraluminal thrombus. Chronic portal vein thrombosis is
characterized by a contracted vein with heterogeneous/hyper-echoic
echoes and may be associated with collateral formation.(Chawla and Bodh
2015; Nouvini and Hapani 2013)

Mesenteric duplex can also assess for functioning of TIPS (transjugular
intrahepatic portosystemic shunt). A sign of a failing TIPS is portal
vein peak systolic velocity less than 30cm/s.

\hypertarget{sec-lab-renal}{%
\subsection{Renal arteries}\label{sec-lab-renal}}

\textbf{Awesome, and so before jumping fully into venous circulation,
let's complete our discussion of abdominal ultrasound evaluation with a
discussion of the renal vasculature.}

\ul{Renal Pathologies:} ostial (atherosclerotic) vs mid-artery (FMD)

\ul{Atherosclerotic stenosis:} PSV \textgreater{} 200 cm/s and
Renal-aortic ratio (RAR) \textgreater3.5, suggest \textgreater60\%
stenosis, however some labs use higher PSV criteria (250-285
cm/s).(Schäberle et al. 2016; Rickey and Geary 2019b) Of note, for RAR,
the aortic PSV needs to be within normal range (40-100) to be
appropriately interpreted.

The renal resistive index (RRI) is calculated as the RA (PSV-EDV)/PSV.
The RRI (\textgreater0.8) is an indicator of intrinsic parenchymal renal
disease. RRI has been used for assessment of transplant renal allograft
rejection, decision making for treatment of renal artery stenosis and to
evaluate progression of CKD.(Radermacher et al. 2001) Diabetic
nephropathy will demonstrate elevated RRI, signifying parenchymal
disease.(Viazzi et al. 2014) One study showed it was associated with
poor renal and overall outcome in critically ill patients.(Le Dorze et
al. 2012)

\ul{FMD:} Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) will demonstrate tortuous renal
arteries with turbulent flow and increased PSV of the mid-distal
portions. Beading may be difficult to see on ultrasound (compared to the
extracranial carotid). Atherosclerosis disease is primarily ostial in
nature.

\ul{In-stent restenosis}: Higher cut off values are required to
determine in stent restenosis.(Chi et al. 2009; Schäberle et al. 2016)

\ul{Renal artery aneurysms:} Can see a yin-yang sign. (Gutta et al.
2008; Ham and Weaver 2014)

\hypertarget{sec-venous}{%
\section{Venous}\label{sec-venous}}

\textbf{Venous Exam:} Uses a linear transducer. Complete deep venous
reflux duplex examination includes color and pulsed wave spectral
doppler imaging. Spontaneous Doppler waveforms as well as provocative
maneuvers are recorded in the common femoral, femoral, popliteal, and
tibial deep veins. Superficial veins (GSV, SSV, and perforator veins)
are evaluated with provocative maneuvers to test valve competency.
Diameters are also included for superficial veins. Transverse B-mode
images are used for vessel compression (as when looking for thrombus) to
ensure that the vein is fully compressible under probe pressure as
opposed to simply slipping out of view, as may occur in longitudinal
views. Reflux exam should be performed with a patient standing, with
assessment performed on the non weight-bearing leg.

\textbf{We've talked extensively about normal arterial waveforms; what
do normal venous waveforms look like?}

\ul{Normal venous waveforms:} Normal flow patterns of iliac and femoral
veins demonstrate phasicity and should augment with distal compression.
In the upper extremity central veins, doppler waveforms normally
demonstrate pulsatility and phasicity.

\textbf{What does this mean? Pulsatility, phasicity, and augmentation}?

\textbf{Pulsatility:} Refers to changes in the venous waveform in
accordance with the cardiac cycle. Pulsatility is normal in the upper
extremity veins central veins, given their proximity to the heart.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{images/vasc_lab2/Slide18.png}

}

\end{figure}

This is an abnormal finding in the lower extremity veins, and may be a
sign of pulmonary hypertension, right heart failure, or tricuspid
regurgitation.(Kakish et al. 1996; McClure et al. 2000)

\textbf{Phasicity:} (also called respiratory phasicity) is variation in
the waveform with respiration. This results from increasing and
decreasing intrathoracic pressures secondary to respiration. Phasicity
is an indicator of a patency proximal to the point of measurement. So if
we see lack of phasicity (continuous flow) in the left femoral vein but
normal phasicity in the right, we would be concerned for left iliac vein
occlusion or stenosis. If we saw absence of phasicity (continuous flow)
in the bilateral femoral veins, we would be concerned for IVC
obstruction or stenosis.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{images/vasc_lab2/Slide19.png}

}

\end{figure}

\textbf{Augmentation:}~Distal compression that augments forward flow.
For example, if we are measuring flow at the femoral vein and we squeeze
the calf and we see augmentation in the waveform, this indicates lack of
occlusion in the venous system from the knee to the probe.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{images/vasc_lab2/Slide20.png}

}

\end{figure}

\textbf{What are venous pathologies that are commonly
tested/encountered?}

\hypertarget{reflux}{%
\subsection{Reflux}\label{reflux}}

Venous reflux due to valvular incompetence is best assessed with duplex
scanning in the upright position. Reflux in the common femoral vein and
the saphenofemoral junction may be elicited with a Valsalva maneuver
(which increases intra-abdominal pressure), but release of a pneumatic
cuff compression is a more reproducible method. Reflux is identified as
reverse flow - that is, away from the heart - following valsalva or
release of the compression cuff.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{images/vasc_lab2/Slide21.png}

}

\end{figure}

Consensus guidelines suggest a cutoff value of 1 second for abnormally
reversed flow (reflux) in the femoral and popliteal veins and of 0.5
seconds for the great saphenous vein, small saphenous vein, tibial, and
deep femoral veins.(Gloviczki et al. 2011; Lurie et al. 2012;
Labropoulos et al. 2003)

\ul{Perforator veins:} Perforator veins connect the deep and superficial
venous systems, penetrating the deep fascia overlying the muscle. Size
\textgreater3.5 mm and reflux \textgreater350 ms (deep to superficial)
is associated with perforator reflux.(Min, Khilnani, and Golia 2003;
O'Donnell et al. 2014; Sandri et al. 1999) Pathological perforators are
found in association with a healed or non-healed ulcer.

\textbf{What are some other examples of reflux?}

\ul{Ovarian vein reflux:} The ultrasound evaluation of pelvic congestion
syndrome is performed in a fasting patient in steep reverse
Trendelenburg and standing positions with a low-frequency probe. Reflux
is identified during the Valsalva maneuver. There are no validated
criteria for the duration of reflux, rather, an ovarian vein diameter
\textgreater6 mm is considered significant.

\hypertarget{may-thurner-syndrome}{%
\subsection{May Thurner Syndrome}\label{may-thurner-syndrome}}

May Thurner syndrome is also known as iliac vein compression syndrome,
refers to a chronic compression of the left
\href{https://radiopaedia.org/articles/common-iliac-vein?lang=us}{common
iliac vein} by the overlying right
\href{https://radiopaedia.org/articles/common-iliac-artery?lang=us}{common
iliac artery} (CIA), with or without
\href{https://radiopaedia.org/articles/deep-vein-thrombosis?lang=us}{deep
venous thrombosis}. Notably, patients present with unilateral (left)
lower extremity edema and pain, varicosities, DVT or venous ulcers.
Intravascular ultrasound will demonstrate \textgreater50\% stenosis of
the iliac vein from compression.

Iliac obstruction, whether a result so May Thurner or not, would
demonstrate continuous flow with a loss of phasicity and reduced
augmentation with distal compression or valsalva. Additional indirect
ultrasound findings include collaterals and reversal of flow. Direct
ultrasound findings include intraluminal changes.(Metzger et al. 2016)

\hypertarget{nutcracker-syndrome-1}{%
\subsection{Nutcracker Syndrome}\label{nutcracker-syndrome-1}}

Nutcracker syndrome is most often diagnosed based on IVUS, venogram or
renal vein pressures, but there are also diagnostic criteria for duplex
ultrasonography. The left renal vein velocity ratio is the velocity at
the aortomesenteric angle divided by the velocity near the left renal
hilum. A ratio greater than 5 has a sensitivity of 80\% and specificity
of 94\% for Nutcracker syndrome.(S. H. Kim et al. 1996; Seung Hyup Kim
2019)

\hypertarget{thrombosis}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Thrombosis}}{Thrombosis}}\label{thrombosis}}

\ul{Thrombosis:} Characteristics of acute thrombus are an echolucent and
incompressible thrombus in a thin-walled vein with significant
distension.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{images/vasc_lab2/Slide22.png}

}

\end{figure}

Acute thrombus typically causes the vein to dilate with a diameter
greater than the diameter of the adjacent artery. Venous wall
thickening/scarring, a contracted vein, recanalization, and collaterals
are found in chronic thrombosis.

Components of a lower extremity DVT study include doppler waveforms in
response to provocative maneuvers in the common femoral, femoral and
popliteal veins. When performing a DVT scan, the technician should
evaluate the contralateral femoral vein flow to compare flow
patterns.(Needleman et al. 2018; Vascular Ultrasound 2019) Transverse
views are used for compression and compressibility testing every 3-5cm
is the most reliable evaluation for thrombus.(Malgor and Labropoulos
2013)

\textbf{Let's discuss some examples of venous thrombosis}

\textbf{Venous TOS:} Venous thoracic outlet syndrome is thrombosis or
severe stenosis of the subclavian or axillary veins secondary to chronic
extrinsic mechanical compression. Repetitive injury to the subclavian
vein at the level of the costoclavicular space results in chronic injury
to the veins. Venous duplex may show a dilated, non-compressible vein
consistent with an acute subclavian vein DVT, or lack of
pulsatility/phasicity if obstruction/stenosis is more centrally located.
Duplex ultrasound is 81-100\% sensitive for diagnosing upper extremity
DVT.(Mustafa et al. 2002)

\textbf{EHIT or Endovenous Heat Induced Thrombosis:} S/p endovenous
thermal ablations (RFA or laser ablation) of the GSV. 4 Grades: Grade 1
is thrombus in the GSV up to the level of the CFV. If \textless{} 50\%
of the CFV lumen is involved this is EHIT grade 2. EHIT grade 3 is
extension into the CFV occupying \textgreater50\% of the lumen and grade
4 is occlusion of the CFV.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{images/vasc_lab2/Slide23.png}

}

\end{figure}

EHIT grades 3-4 are typically treated with anticoagulation to reduce
risk of PE. To minimize the risk of EHIT, the catheter should be
positioned at least 2 cm from the saphenofemoral junction.

\textbf{Superficial vein thrombosis:} when scanning for superficial vein
thrombosis, pornographers should scan superficial and deep veins of the
ipsilateral leg and the contralateral central veins with doppler wave
form, because the incidence of concomitant thrombosis is not
insignificant.(Decousus et al. 2010; IAC 2021; Vascular Ultrasound 2019)
This is discussed more in our venous chapter:
Section~\ref{sec-superficial-vein-thrombosis}

\hypertarget{vein-mapping}{%
\subsection{Vein Mapping}\label{vein-mapping}}

One additional venous study often performed in the lower extremity is
mapping of the GSV for planning lower extremity bypasses. Mapping should
identify the general course of the GSV and any major tributaries,
particularly if the anterior or posterior accessory veins are of a size
that might be a reasonable additional conduit.(Cohn, Caggiati, and
Korver 2006) Sonographers should also make note of any significant areas
of tortuosity or aneurysm that might compromise the quality of the
bypass conduit. Size measurements are usually made along the GSV.

In general the ideal size for conduit is 3-4mm throughout it's length,
with a size of greater than 2mm at the ankle.(Leopold et al. 1989) These
size assessments are usually the same regardless of whether the vein
will be fully harvested and reversed or utilized in situ. The small
saphenous vein can be utilized for a conduit if the GSV is not adequate
and the diameter is 3-4mm.(B. B. Chang et al. 1992; Nierlich et al.
2019)

\hypertarget{artifacts}{%
\section{Artifacts}\label{artifacts}}

Finally, let's wrap up this episode with a discussion of imaging
artifacts. These are frequently encountered and tested in vascular
ultrasound, and it is important to recognize imaging artifacts in order
to prevent incorrect interpretation.

\textbf{Acoustic shadowing:} Shadowing on an ultrasound image is
characterized by a signal void behind structures that strongly absorb,
reflect, or refract ultrasonic waves.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{images/vasc_lab2/Slide24.png}

}

\end{figure}

Practically speaking, this most typically occurs deep to strongly
reflective surfaces such as calcified plaques, and appears as a ``dark
area'' beneath the plaque. Subcutaneous air can result in shadowing and
loss of imaging information, which can be seen in some soft tissue
necrotising infections.(Thom and Warlaumont 2017)

\textbf{Acoustic enhancement} is essentially the inverse situation, and
appears as a ``bright area'' deep to structures that transmit ultrasound
waves exceptionally well. This can happen deep to fluid-filled
structures such as cysts.

\textbf{Mirroring}: A mirror-image artifact is caused by reverberation
of ultrasound and shows structures that exist on one side of a strong
reflector as also being present on the other side of the reflector.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{images/vasc_lab2/Slide25.png}

}

\end{figure}

This is often seen around the pleura and the diaphragm, due to the
strong reflection of ultrasound from the air-filled lung. These
artifacts can occur in both B-mode imaging where you see the mirrored
image and Doppler, in which you see the mirrored waveform. The clavicle
is also a strong spectral reflector, and thus can result in a mirror
effect and a duplicate subclavian artery.(Rubin et al. 2010)

\textbf{Refraction:} A refraction artifact is the result of ultrasound
waves passing through tissues with different propagation velocities
(such as air and water) and causes a structure to be improperly
positioned laterally in the image. This is the phenomenon that results
in a straw appearing bent when in a glass of water.

\textbf{Speed artifact:} Depth determination by an ultrasound machine is
based on calculations using an average propagation velocity of sound in
soft tissue of 1540 m/s. If the ultrasound wave passes through a medium
at a different speed than predicted by the machine, an inaccurate image
depth will be displayed. If the ultrasound passes less quickly through
the material than soft tissue (as occurs in air or fluid), then the
image will be displayed deeper than the true depth. In practical
application, this is what causes a ``bayonet'' sign, or apparent bending
of a needle when it passes from soft tissue into a cystic structure.

\textbf{Inappropriate color gain:} Overly gained images will show
``speckling'' in areas in which no flow is present (such as in soft
tissue). Increasing the gain, increases both the signal and the
noise.(Kremkau 2021) The noise added to the spectral waveform can result
in PSV overestimation.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{images/vasc_lab2/Slide26.png}

}

\end{figure}

Under-gaining will result in reduced sensitivity to low velocity flow.

\textbf{Inappropriate angle correction:} Make sure the angle correction
cursor is centered in the vessel and parallel to the walls, otherwise
the Doppler velocity measurement will be incorrect. Increasing the
doppler angle will increase the velocity measurement (if no change to
angle correction is made).

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{images/vasc_lab2/Slide27.png}

}

\end{figure}

Finally, can we talk about aliasing, as I feel like this comes up a lot
on exams:

\textbf{Aliasing:} Unlike
\href{https://radiopaedia.org/articles/continuous-wave-doppler?lang=us}{continuous
wave Doppler}, pulsed wave and color flow Doppler are characterized by
rapid pulses of ultrasound waves (at a rate called the pulse repetition
frequency). The
\href{https://radiopaedia.org/articles/nyquist-limit?lang=us}{Nyquist
limit} defines the frequency at which aliasing will occur, as equal to
the PRF/2. So what does this mean practically? In pulsed wave doppler,
if the velocity of blood is greater than ½ the PRF, the peak velocity
will be cut off, and wrapped around to the bottom of the scale.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{images/vasc_lab2/Slide28.png}

}

\end{figure}

This results in inaccurate measurement of peak velocities, and may be
remedied by increasing the PRF and hence the scale. In color flow
doppler, aliasing appears as red to blue hues without separation of a
black region indicating no flow. This occurs in areas of high velocity
(such as immediately post-stenosis). This can be remedied with an
increase in the color scale. Of note, if asked to determine the
direction of blood flow in a vessel demonstrating aliasing, one should
assess the flow in low-velocity areas of blood flow, as seen along
vessel walls.

\textbf{Absorbed Dose} - energy deposited by ionizing radiation in a
medium per unit mass. Dosage measured and communicated most commonly in
Gray (Gy) equal to 100 rad.(A. B. Reed 2019)

\textbf{Effective Dose} - energy deposited by ionizing radiation in a
medium, taking into account the sensitivity of the specific tissue, time
and duration of exposure. These factors compose a weighting factor (W)
and thus this is calculated by multiplying absorbed dose (Gy) by the
weighting factor (W). Dosage measured and communicated most commonly in
Sievert (Sv) equal to 100 rem.(A. B. Reed 2019)

\textbf{Reference Air Karma (RAK)} - Radiation output at a specific
reference point along a fluoroscopic axis.(Kirkwood et al. 2013)

\begin{itemize}

the RAK that is reported at the end of the procedure, which is an

\hypertarget{radiation-effects}{%
\section{Radiation effects}\label{radiation-effects}}

The effects can impact both patients and clinicians. Patients often
receive a higher dose during a single procedure, where as clinician
doses, even with proper shielding, accumulate over multiple procedures
throughout their careers. The effects of radiation are defined as either
deterministic or stochastic.

The ocular lens is the most radio-sensitive tissue and cataracts is an
unfortunately common deterministic effect.(Machan 2018; Brown and
Rzucidlo 2011) Annual limits for occupational exposure include 20mSv per
year and total threshold of 0.5Gy, which was recently lowered due to
risk of cataract development from ocular exposure.(Hamada et al. 2017)

Stochastic effects can occur after exposure of any dose, but are seen
more frequently in populations with higher radiation exposure. These are
based on population studies and exact dose dependent relationships have
not been established. These include:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Brain cancer(Rajaraman et al. 2016; Kirkwood et al. 2018)

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Position the source as far away from the operator as possible to still
  achieve optimal imaging. Radiation dose changes according to the
  inverse square of distance. Therefore twice the distance results in
  one quarter the dose.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    For example, left anterior oblique (LAO) will bring the source to
    the patient's right side, causing higher doses to clinicians on that
    side of the patient.(Kirkwood et al. 2013; Sailer et al. 2019)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Appropriate shielding

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Recommendations are that clinicians wear lead aprons covering their
    torso and legs with a thyroid shield and leaded glasses.
  \item
    Collimation can be helpful to reduce patient and operator dose,
    scatter and improve image quality.(Haqqani et al. 2012)
  \item
    The location with the highest exposure to scatter is below the
    table.(Gonzales, Moran, and Silberzweig 2014; Miller et al. 2010)
    Therefore, leaded skirt and extended lower body shields reduce
    radiation to the operator's legs.(Kirkwood et al. 2015)
  \item
    Of note: leaded caps DO NOT reduce radiation exposure to the brain
    because the majority of radiation is received as scatter from the
    patient up through the face and neck.(Kirkwood et al. 2018)
  \item
    Lead shielding should be regularly inspected and discarded if
    damaged. Particularly if defect is \textgreater15mm2 on a critical
    organ area, \textgreater670mm2 along a seem/overlapping area,
    \textgreater11mm2 on a thyroid shield.(Healthcare Inspections 2014;

\hypertarget{pregnancy-considerations}{%
\subsection{Pregnancy considerations}\label{pregnancy-considerations}}

Pregnancy of both patients and clinicians need to be considered in
relation to radiation exposure and safety.(V. Chandra et al. 2013;
Mitchell and Furey 2011; P. Shaw et al. 2011) This is a highly tested
subject on vascular surgery examinations. Some important take aways
include:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  CDC has released guidance for potential prenatal effects on radiation
  exposure(CDC 2011) The majority of effects on fetuses is extrapolated
  from studies of the fall out from Hiroshima, Nagasaki and Chernobyl.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \textless0.05Gy represents no measurable risk to embryo or fetus at
    any gestational age.
  \item
    0.05-0.5Gy can be dangerous in the first trimester, but has not been
    associated with defects later in pregnancy.(P. Shaw et al. 2011)
  \item
    \textgreater0.5Gy can be dangerous at any point during pregnancy.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Dose limit recommendations during the 9 months of pregnancy is 5 mSv
  (500mrem) or 0.5 mSv (50mrem) per month.(Dauer et al. 2015; V. Chandra
  et al. 2013)
\end{itemize}

Strategies to reduce exposure include:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Avoid direct fluoroscopy to the fetus, high-gantry angulation, and
  femoral access

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Use collimation to ensure fetus is excluded from imaging field.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Use adjuncts of intravascular ultrasound and lead shielding when able.
\item
  Limit fluoro time.
\item
  Some recommendations state that operators who intend to get pregnant
  should start wearing maternity aprons (lead equivalent to 1mm) even
  prior to knowing they are pregnant.(P. Shaw et al. 2011)

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Original studies demonstrated reduction in fetal exposure by 80\%
    and is currently common practice.(Witrak and Sprawls 1984)
  \item
    However, a recent multi-institutional review showed that fetal
    exposure is minimal even in regular lead, therefore the additional
    weight of maternal lead may be unnecessary.(V. Chandra et al. 2013)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{regulation}{%
\subsection{Regulation}\label{regulation}}

Joint Commission Oversight - sentinel radiation reporting is aimed to
promote awareness of preventable events perform root cause analyses to
understand the reasons for events.(Commission 2019) It is important to
escalate events early, as effects may not occur until much
later.(Arbique, n.d.) Sentinel events include:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  The patient has a permanent cutaneous injury and the proper dose
  saving techniques were not used during the procedure
\item
  Cumulative dose of 15 Gy for a single field over 6mo - 1yr.
\item
  Delivery of radiotherapy to the wrong body region.
\item
  Actual dose more than 25\% above planned radiotherapy dose.(A. K.
  Jones and Pasciak 2011)
\end{enumerate}

Institutional Oversight - many institutions develop their own guidelines
for employee exposure and mitigation strategies. Some common policies
regarding dose limits include:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Monthly limit for dosimeter reading of 0.1 mSv (100mrem) per month.
\item
  Recommendations for annual occupational dose is \textless20mSv per
  year averaged over 5y and no more than 50mSv in any one year.
  Occupational dose \textless100mSv per year is not thought to increase
  cancer risk

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Recent reduction of occupational dose limit to 50mSv is due to
    increasing data connecting cataracts to radiation exposure.(Hamada
    et al. 2017)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{contrast-reduction}{%
\section{Contrast Reduction}\label{contrast-reduction}}

The most common complications related to iodinated contrast during
endovascular procedures are hypersensitivities and acute kidney injury.
There are a number of mitigation strategies to limit the effect of
contrast on patients undergoing endovascular procedures.

In general patients with food allergies do have an increased incidence
of contrast media allergies, however no specific common allergen has
been identified. A new seafood allergy should not postpone or require
pre-medication if a patient has previously tolerated IV
contrast.(Schabelman and Witting 2010)

\hypertarget{co2-angiography}{%
\subsection{CO2 Angiography}\label{co2-angiography}}

CO2 angiography is often utilized in place of iodinated contrast during
fluoroscopy. A bolus of CO2 is injected, which then absorbs less
ionizing radiation than surrounding tissue and provides a map of the
arterial tree. CO2 can be used in a wide range of endovascular
procedures, even a ruptured AAA.(Knipp et al. 2010) However, there are
specific limitations and complications that should be understood.

\hypertarget{limitations}{%

  \begin{itemize}

\chapter{Endovascular Access}\label{sec-endovascular}}

Authors: \emph{Sammy Siada and Rafael Demarchi Malgor}

Endovascular procedures are the cornerstone of any modern vascular
surgery practice. Because most endovascular procedures are performed
percutaneously using arterial or venous access, it is critical that
vascular surgeons are facile with various techniques and devices used
for endovascular access. Today we'll be discussing the various access
sites, techniques for access, closure devices, and complications.

\textbf{What factors play a role when choosing a site for access?}

The factors to think about when thinking about which vessel to access
are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The appropriateness of the access site the procedure performed
\item
  Ability to obtain hemostasis at the conclusion of the procedure
\item
  Ability to convert to open if necessary
\item
  Effects of access on the tissues supplied by the accessed vessel and
  distal limb perfusion
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What makes a vessel appropriate for access?}

One of the most important factors when planning your access is the size
of the vessel. The vessel needs to be able to accommodate the catheters
and devices that will be used to perform the procedure. For instance, a
brachial artery with less than 4mm diameter should not be accessed by a
large bore sheaths, such as a 12Fr sheath.

The vessel also needs to be a in a location that can allow access to the
target vessel of interest. Additionally, the vessel needs to have an
area that is relatively healthy to access the vessel safely and minimize
complications. Heavily calcified vessels especially those with anterior
wall calcification might not be appropriate for access.

\textbf{What about the ability obtaining hemostasis at the end of the
procedure?}

The ability to obtain hemostasis is critical to be able to perform
endovascular procedures safely which is one reason why the common
femoral artery is the most commonly accessed vessel.

Hemostasis is most commonly achieved through manual compression by
compressing the artery against the femoral head. The brachial artery can
also be compressed against the humerus, but because it's a more mobile
vessel, compression is less effective and can lead to hematoma or
pseudoaneurysm formation which may necessitate an operation to prevent
compression of the median nerve

Patients who will need to be uninterruptedly anticoagulated peri- and
post-operatively pose a challenge to hemostasis. The use of closure
devices is very important in these situations to prevent access
bleeding.

A variety of closure devices can also be used to assist in hemostasis,
each with their own inherent advantages and disadvantages. In general,
closure devices are contraindicated in small diameter and heavily
calcified vessels.

\textbf{In any minimally invasive procedure, there is always a chance
that you may need to convert to open. How does converting to open play a
role in vascular access?}

Conversion to open is uncommon with vessel access accounting for
\textless5\% of the cases. Sometimes a large sheath is accidentally
pulled out and a cutdown becomes necessary to repair the artery. Closure
devices aren't 100\% effective in hemostasis and may also require a
cutdown for definitive control if they fail, especially when obtaining
large bore access.

This makes choosing the right vessel critical. For example, if a large
sheath is accidentally pulled out of the CFA during an EVAR, the repair
can be done through a straightforward groin cutdown. In contrast, the
subclavian artery is rarely accessed percutaneously because converting
to open would require a more challenging peri-clavicular incision or
even a thoracotomy for repair.

\textbf{Large diameter sheaths are often used, particularly in aortic
procedures. These sheaths can be occlusive which can result in
downstream tissue ischemia. What considerations should be taken when
thinking about downstream tissue ischemia?}

When performing diagnostic procedures using small diameter sheaths and
catheters, anticoagulation may or may not be necessary depending on how
diseased the access vessel is.

However, when using large devices (e.g.~in EVARs), the sheaths can be
partially or completely occlusive which mandates full anticoagulation to
prevent thrombosis. The other thing to consider is the length of time
that the sheath remains in the vessel as the leg can only tolerate
ischemia for 4-6 hours. This is usually pertinent when performing
complex endovascular aortic procedures.

To minimize downstream tissue ischemia, a large bore sheath should be
pulled back to decrease the length of vessel obstruction by its shaft in
order to unblock proximal vessel collateral branch vessels. For
instance, when performing an aortic procedure through a femoral access
attempt to pull the sheath back into the external iliac artery to
increase distal limb perfusion through the internal to femoral artery
collateral branch vessels.

The long story short is to be liberal with anticoagulation when there is
reduced flow in the vessel such as the iliofemoral system during EVAR or
tibial access

\textbf{Do the principles that we've described also apply to veins?}

The same principles apply but there are some notable differences between
arterial and venous access.

Veins are a low-pressure system, so hemostasis is easier to achieve and
hemorrhagic complications are much less common. However, this poses a
challenge during access as there is less radial force keeping the vein
open making the vein more susceptible to compression by the ultrasound
probe and the needle.

If a large bore sheath is necessary to perform a venous procedure, a
suture-mediated closure device can be utilized to achieve hemostasis
especially in patients that will be kept fully anticoagulated

Additionally, a syringe may be needed to confirm access and can also
prevent air embolism

\textbf{Let's talk about accessing the common femoral artery. Why is the
CFA the most common vessel used for access?}

It is large caliber and can accommodate large sheaths up to 26-28 Fr.~It
also allows for a wide set of procedures and is ergonomically easy to
work with given its location. It is relatively easy to hold manual
pressure and if a conversion to open is needed, a femoral cutdown is
relatively straightforward.

\textbf{Where in the common femoral artery is the best spot to access?}

The ideal puncture site is in the CFA in the medial third of the femoral
head in between the inguinal ligament and the femoral bifurcation in the
middle of the femoral head.

Accessing the vessel above the inguinal ligament makes compressing the
artery very difficult which can lead to life-threatening retroperitoneal
bleed.

A puncture that is too distal and into the SFA increase the risk of
thrombosis or dissection causing acute limb ischemia as well as AV
fistula formation between the superficial femoral and profunda femoris
artery.

\textbf{What are the different ways to obtain CFA access?}

There are three different ways to access the CFA: manual palpation,
fluoroscopic guided, and ultrasound guided.

With manual palpation, a finger is placed above and below the desired
access point directly on the pulse and the needle is inserted in between
the two fingers.

Fluoroscopic guidance uses bony landmarks relative to the position of
the needle.

The standard of care in the modern era for obtaining CFA access is to
use ultrasound guidance. Ultrasound allows visualization of the vessel
and surrounding structures. PAD within the vessel can readily be
identified with ultrasound, allowing safe access in a relatively
disease-free part of the artery. Ultrasound also clearly shows the
femoral bifurcation. Using ultrasound allows for subtle corrections in
the angle of the needle and how it interacts with the surrounding
tissues. It is rapid, real-time, inexpensive, and safe.(Sorrentino et
al. 2020)

\textbf{What anatomic considerations should be taken when accessing the
CFA?}

The CFA is the continuation of the external iliac artery as it courses
under the inguinal ligament. It is about 5-8 cm in length and then
bifurcates in to the superficial femoral and profunda femoris arteries

The inguinal ligament is a good external landmark to estimate where the
CFA is. It is critical to emphasize that the inguinal ligament does not
correspond to the groin crease and this is especially true in obese
patients. An imaginary line is drawn from the ASIS to the pubic
tubercle. The artery generally runs a third of the way from the pubic
tubercle to the ASIS. A metallic instrument can be placed in this area
to mark it externally and a fluoroscopic image can be obtained to
identify the relation of the instrument to the medial third of the
femoral head. This imaginary line also marks the superior-most extent of
the access

The CFA is most often accessed in a retrograde fashion in between the
inguinal ligament and femoral bifurcation. This allows for a multitude
of potential diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in most parts of the
body.

\textbf{Can the CFA be accessed antegrade?}

Yes. Sometimes antegrade CFA access is used when performing an
intervention distal on the ipsilateral leg. The advantage of antegrade
access is better pushability and torquability of wires, catheters, and
sheaths when performing complex peripheral intervention where no other
proximal procedures are needed.

Antegrade access is more challenging than retrograde access, however.
This is particularly true in patients with a very short CFA, short
distance between the inguinal ligament and the femoral bifurcation
because the needle requires a steeper angle of entry to allow for
cannulation well above the femoral bifurcation.

Obtaining antegrade access is especially difficult in obese patients and
will usually require an assistant to retract the pannus to allow proper
needle placement. I would say antegrade access is relatively
contraindicated in morbidly obese patients with large pannus. Ultrasound
guidance remains key here as well.

\textbf{What are some other commonly accessed arteries for endovascular
procedures?}

The tibial vessels can be accessed percutaneously for retrograde
recanalization for severe LE PAD. It is usually performed using
micropuncture kits which we will discuss a little later. It is usually
done with ultrasound guidance and uses small sheaths and wires. The PT
and AT are more commonly used because they are easier to access.

The radial artery is commonly used in coronary interventions and is
increasingly being used by vascular surgeons. It is easily palpable over
the distal radius and can be cannulated with ease. Hemostasis is
straightforward using compression. In the rare setting of radial
occlusion, the hand rarely becomes ischemic because most people are
ulnar dominant. It can accommodate sheaths up to 6 French.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The best way to reduce vasospasm and injury to the radial artery is
  utilizing a radial artery cocktail - calcium channel blocker,
  vasodilator, and anticoagulation.(Mason et al. 2018; Cauley et al.
  2019)
\end{itemize}

The brachial artery can be accessed percutaneously over the olecranon
process with the arm supinated.(Alvarez-Tostado et al. 2009) Ultrasound
guidance allows for visualization of the brachial bifurcation. It can
accommodate 6-7 Fr sheaths. Hemostasis is critically important as
bleeding can result in a hematoma that results in median nerve
compression, which is a surgical emergency. Cut down after brachial
access has been shown to reduce complications.(Kret et al. 2016)

\textbf{Let's not forget about venous access. What are some of the most
commonly accessed veins?}

The CFV is commonly accessed for procedures involving the IVC and iliac
vessels and their branches for conditions such as May-Thurner, pelvic
congestion syndrome, and IVC filter placement. Treatment of PE can also
be performed through the CFV. The CFV can easily be compressed over the
femoral head and is located medial to the CFA. Ultrasound guidance
should be used to prevent arterial injury and backwalling.

The internal jugular vein can be accessed using US guidance (to prevent
carotid injury; IJ is lateral to the carotid). IJ access is used most
commonly for central venous catheters as well as IVC placement and
filter retrieval. It is also an excellent access to treat pulmonary
embolism via thrombolysis or thrombectomy. The IJ can be utilized to
perform ovarian and internal iliac vein embolization. IJ is also the
preferred access to perform TIPS, which is often of less interest to
vascular surgeon.

The popliteal vein can be accessed with the patient in the prone
position or the distal femoral vein in the supine position to diagnose
and treat DVTs of the extremity veins. Ultrasound is also helpful to
avoid arterial access and especially if the vein is thrombosed

Arm veins (cephalic/basilic) can be also readily accessed for vein
mapping or fistula interventions.

\textbf{Let's move on to access technique. Historically, there are two
types of puncture needles: single-wall and double-wall. Can you talk
about the differences?}

Double wall needles were commonly used back in the day for femoral
access. They have an outer hollow blunt-tipped needle and an inner sharp
stylet. The needle was inserted through and through the artery and the
stylet removed and the blunt hollow needle pulled back until blood is
returned. These aren't favored anymore because they cause unnecessary
backwalling of the artery. Double wall access kits are used in treating
endoleaks from both a transcaval and translumbar routes to allow access
into the aneurysm sack and needle removal to avoid puncturing the
endograft.

Single wall needles are typically the choice for diagnostic procedures.
18-gauge needles accommodate an 0.035 in wire and 21 gauge accommodates
a 0.018 in wire.

\textbf{Can you describe the micropuncture technique for percutaneous
access?}

Micropuncture technique is the most commonly used method for
percutaneous access nowadays. The advantage of the micropuncture
technique is the use of a small needle which can be removed and
repositioned with a negligible risk of bleeding and minimal amount of
manual compression needed.

Ultrasound is used to cannulate the artery with a 21-gauge needle. It is
best to visualize the needle entering the artery and to be intraluminal
without being against the wall Blood return is then seen and a floppy
tip micropuncture (0.018) wire is inserted under fluoroscopic guidance
to make sure the wire passes into the vessel easily. A 4 Fr introducer
sheath is placed over the wire gently to avoid kinking the wire. The
inner cannula of the sheath is removed, and a 0.035 guidewire is placed
under fluoroscopic guidance. It is important to remember that there are
two types of introducer sheath depending on amount of subcutaneous scar
tissue containing either a soft or a stiffened cannula. The 4 Fr is
removed over the wire while holding manual pressure and desired sheath
(usually 5 or 6 Fr) is placed for definitive access. The side port is
then aspirated for arterial blood and flushed with heparinized saline.

\hypertarget{sec-access-comp}{%
\section{Complications}\label{sec-access-comp}}

\textbf{With any invasive procedure, there are risks of complications.
What are some of the complications of percutaneous vascular access?}

Hematomas are the most common complication and have an incidence of
about 3\%. Most of these hematomas are clinically insignificant but
retroperitoneal hemorrhage from a high puncture above the inguinal
ligament can be life-threatening. These may require conversion to open
and direct repair of the vessel or covered stent placement (especially
if the puncture is above the inguinal ligament). Proximal balloon
occlusion can be helpful to control hemorrhage while the vessel is being
repaired.

Groin hematomas are not uncommon and are usually self-limiting. An
expanding hematoma that is seen early can be treated with simple manual
pressure at the bedside. If the hematoma is large and compressing
surrounding structures or threatening skin integrity or if the patient
is hemodynamically unstable, then surgical evacuation may be necessary

Pseudoaneurysms are an uncommon complication with an incidence of about
0.6\%. Most pseudoaneurysms are treated with ultrasound-guided
compression or thrombin injection. Thrombin injection requires a narrow
neck into the pseudoaneurysm. If the pseudoaneurysm is \textgreater2cm,
compresses surrounding structures, threatens skin integrity, or has
failed thrombin injection, then surgical repair is required.(Morgan and
Belli 2003; Patrick A. Stone, Campbell, and AbuRahma 2014) For a
representative image, see Section~\ref{sec-lab-psa}

Thrombosis of the CFA is a known complication but fortunately is rare
with an incidence of 0.2\%. This can result from manual compression of
the CFA that has severe atherosclerotic disease or prior groin
reconstruction. This generally requires a cutdown, endarterectomy,
thrombectomy, and patch angioplasty.

Lastly, AV fistula can form and are usually between the femoral artery
and vein with an incidence of 0.5-0.9\%). These usually occur from a low
puncture of the CFA bifurcation or profunda. They are usually
asymptomatic and detected on exam (palpable thrill) and confirmed with
duplex imaging. If the fistula is small, it generally can be observed
with close duplex surveillance. If it enlarges or becomes symptomatic,
then repair is indicated. Covered stent grafts can be placed with
minimal morbidity, making this optimal for high risk patients. Open
surgery also is highly successful. Deciding between non-operative,
endovascular, or open treatment is up for debate and is up to the
clinical judgement of the surgeon.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Toward probe is up on waveform (MCA, ICA)
\item
  Away from probe is down on waveform (ACA)
\item
  PCA is bidirectional (P1 before PCommA is up, P2 after PCommA is down)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{TCD orbital window:}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Ophthalmic is toward probe
\item
  ICA in siphon is bidirectional
\end{itemize}

\textbf{TCD occipital window:}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  vertebral and basilar away from probe (think direction on carotid
  duplex)
\end{itemize}

Consider shunt during CEA if MCA velocity drops by 50\% or more A
doubling of MCA mean velocity suggests cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome

Lindegaard ratio 3-6 indicates spasm, \textgreater{} 6 indicates severe
spasm. PSV in MCA relative to extracranial ICA.

\hypertarget{basics}{%
\subsection{Basics}\label{basics}}

Power doppler is like amplitude, good for low flow evaluation but you
lose directionality (think absolute values). Good for detecting string
sign, low flow in renal parenchyma, or torsion. Not useful for
directionality of flow (e.g., TCD or vertebral direction), and will not
alias.

Depth resolution (synonymous with axial, longitudinal range) in PW mode
is limited by half the spatial pulse length (SPL). As long as the
resolution between objects is less than half the SPL, objects can be
discriminated (because the total distance doubles going round). Shorter
SPL means you can distinguish smaller things, which means better
(smaller) resolution. Shorter SPL theoretically is achieved by shorter
wavelength/higher frequency, more damping, shorter pulse duration. It is
not technically affected by PRF/PRP.

PRP = time between pulses = imaging depth (ID) * 13 microseconds/cm note
that PRF = 1/PRP, and that PRFs are generally 5-40 kHz

Maximum Doppler shift detectable = Nyquist limit = PRF/2. Remember this
only applies to PW Doppler. CW Doppler has no practical limit beyond
which aliasing occurs. Use caution between depth resolution (2x SPL) and
Nyquist limit (1/2 PRF)
