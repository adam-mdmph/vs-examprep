    "text": "1.2 Presentation\n\nWhat is the definition of crescendo TIAs?\nThe presenting symptoms of extracranial carotid disease is of the utmost importance to understand because it is a major factor in determining treatment and prognosis. Focal neurologic symptoms that occur suddenly and then resolve within 24 hours are called a transient ischemic attach (TIA). If the deficit persists beyond 24 hours, then it is considered a stroke. Strokes are then graded according to the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS).(Fischer et al. 2010)\nA particularly confusing distinction is between a crescendo TIA and a stroke in evolution. A crescendo TIA is frequent repetitive neurological attacks without complete resolution of the deficit between the episodes, usually over a 24 hour period. The result of which is the same neurological deficit. If the patient exhibits progressive deterioration in neurological function between TIA episodes this is classified as a stroke in evolution not a crescendo TIA.(Ricotta 2019) These are both particularly concerning findings and may be an indication for an emergent intervention.\nWho needs to be screened for carotid disease?\nNot everyone should be screened for carotid disease, however, there is merit in screening high risk patients as only 15% of patients experience a warning TIA prior to a stroke.(Rockman 2019) The purpose of carotid bifurcation imaging is to detect “stroke-prone” carotid bifurcation plaque and identify a high-risk patient likely to benefit from therapy designed to reduce stroke risk.\nTraditionally, the clinical sign associated with asymptomatic carotid stenosis is the presence of a neck bruit on auscultation. Focal ipsilateral carotid bruits in symptomatic patients has a sensitivity of 63% and a specificity of 61% for high-grade carotid stenosis (range, 70%-99%).(Sauve 1994) As these figures suggest the absence of carotid bruit does not absolutely exclude the presence of a significant carotid bifurcation lesion, therefore additional criteria are used to determine which patients would benefit from screening:\n\nEvidence of clinically significant peripheral vascular disease regardless of age\nPatients aged >65 years with a history of one or more of the following atherosclerotic risk factors:\n\nCAD\nSmoking\nHypercholesterolemia\n\n\nIn general, the more risk factors present, the higher the yield of screening for the patient. Presence of a carotid bruit, AAA or family history of disease alone is not sufficient to warrant imaging.(Aburahma and Perler 2022)"

    "section": "1.4 Management",
    "text": "1.4 Management\n\n1.4.1 Medical - Asymptomatic Patients\nFirst line management for asymptomatic patients with carotid stenosis is medical optimization of risk factors. The benefit of prophylactic intervention (CEA/CAS) of even high grade stenosis is estimated at a 1-2% stroke reduction risk per year. (A. Ross Naylor 2015) In addition, keep in mind that intervention (CEA/CAS) has only demonstrated a benefit in asymptomatic patient with life expectancy greater than 3 years. (Bulbulia and Halliday 2017; Halliday et al. 2010; Rosenfield et al. 2016)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake a Listen\n\n\n\nCheck out our conversation with Prof Ross Naylor where he discusses in depth his decision making for asymptomatic carotid disease and other controversies in carotid disease management.\n\n\nHypertension\n\nBlood pressure reduction, with a target of <140/90 mmHg through lifestyle interventions and anti-hypertensive treatment is recommended in individuals who have hypertension with asymptomatic carotid atherosclerosis or those with TIA or stroke after the hyper-acute period.\nEach 10-mm Hg reduction in blood pressure among hypertensive patients decreases the risk of stroke by 33% in patients aged 60-79.(Aiyagari and Gorelick 2009)\n\nDiabetes\n\nIn diabetic patients glycaemic control to nearly normoglycemic levels (target hemoglobin A1C <7%) is recommended to reduce microvascular complications and, with a smaller evidence base, macrovascular complications other than stroke.(Ricotta 2019)\n\nHyperlipidemia\n\nStatin agents are recommended targeting LDL of 100 mg/dL, for those with coronary heart disease or symptomatic atherosclerotic disease, and LDL of 70 mg/dL for very high-risk persons with multiple risk factors.\nHigh dose statin therapy in patients with TIA/stroke reduce future rates of stroke or cardiovascular events but not overall mortality at 5 years. (Karam, Loney-Hutchinson, and McFarlane 2008)\n\nSmoking Cessation - Encouraging smoking cessation is paramount for these patients. Smoking and carotid disease have been found to have a dose dependent relationship based on pack-years. Risk of stroke has been shown to reduce to baseline within 2-4 years of smoking cessation.(Hicks et al. 2015; Kawachi et al. 1993; Petrik et al. 1995; Wilson et al. 1997) For more on smoking cessation, see Section 15.2.2.1\nAntiplatelet therapy - Single agent antiplatelet therapy, most often aspirin, is often all that is needed, but this should be weighted with other cardiovascular risk factors. A number of trials have showed limited benefit of adding an additional antiplatelet or routinely testing for clopidogrel resistance.(Ricotta 2019)\n\n\n1.4.2 Medical - Symptomatic Patients\nPatients who present with a TIA should be placed on dual antiplatelet therapy, often aspirin and clopidogrel, which are continued through the workup and treatment of carotid disease. Patients often also have their blood pressure medications reduced to allow permissive hypertension and maximize perfusion to at risk cerebral tissue.\nWhile we are not often directly involved in the management of acute stroke, vascular surgeons should be aware of best practices in this area. Management of acute stroke currently follow these timelines(Powers et al. 2018)\n\n< 4.5 hours from onset of symptoms - medical thrombolysis with tPA unless contraindicated.\n\nPatient age >80 and diabetes are contraindications to tPA administration after 3hrs.\nOther contraindications include - hypertension, intracranial hemorrhage, recent stroke or cranial trauma, spine/brain surgery within 3 months, GI bleed within 21 days.\nBP management post stroke with thrombolysis includes treatment of BP to <185/110 prior to administration of thrombolysis, then keep <180/105 for 24hrs post administration.\n\n<6 hours from onset of symptoms - catheter directed therapy\nAfter 6 hours, there is limited benefit to thrombolytic therapy.\n\nBP management post stroke without thrombosis includes an initial period of permissive hypertension, treat only if >220/120. Slowly lower BP to target of 140/90 over 7-14d - particularly important to go slow in patients with intra- or extra-cranial large vessel stenosis.\n\nContraindications to permissive hypertension include active CAD, heart failure, aortic dissection, hypertensive encephalopathy.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4.3 Surgical - Carotid Endarterectomy\n\n1.4.3.1 Indications\n\nRecommendations on when to operate after a TIA/stroke.\n\nAcute stroke with a fixed neurologic deficit of >6h duration - When the patient is medically stable, intervention in 14 days or less after stroke is preferable. (Rothwell et al. 2004; Meershoek and de Borst 2018)\nConsider urgent intervention in a medically stable patient with mild-moderate neurologic deficit, if there is a significant area of ischemic penumbra at risk for progression on imaging that is contributing to the patient’s presentation.\nStroke in evolution (fluctuating / evolving neurological deficit) or crescendo TIA (repetitive transient ischemia with improvement between events) - If the patient’s neurological status is not stabilized by medical intervention then an urgent CEA should be considered.\nIn this clinical context CEA is preferred to CAS based on an increased embolic potential of carotid lesions. (Rantner et al. 2017)\n\nWhat is the only emergent indication for CEA?\n\nCrescendo TIAs or a stroke in evolution with a surgically correctable lesion identified on imaging.\n\n\n\n\n1.4.3.2 Techniques\n\nGeneral concepts\n\nPatch angioplasty or eversion endarterectomy are recommended over primary arterial closure due to decreased ipsilateral stroke, perioperative carotid occlusion, return to the operating room, restenosis and 1-year stroke rates.(Goodney et al. 2010; K. Rerkasem and Rothwell 2009) Patch repair is considered the standard of care surgical management for most extracranial carotid lesions.(Arnold and Perler 2019)\n\nNeuromonitoring/Shunting options during a carotid endarterectomy(Chongruksut, Vaniyapong, and Rerkasem 2014; Wiske et al. 2018)\n\nLocal/regional anesthesia with direct neurological monitoring - the benefit being that the patient is awake and moving to command throughout the case. Indications for shunting include lateralizing deficits, seizure, lack of consciousness and severe anxiety. Improved neuromonitoring, however, has not been shown to reduce myocardial infarction rate with CEA.(A. Rerkasem et al. 2021)\nStump pressure- Clamp the inflow and place a butterfly attached to a-line tubing into the internal carotid artery. If the stump pressure is >40mmHg the surgeon can chose to proceed without shunt placement, if <40mmHg then a shunt should be placed prior to proceeding. There remains some controversy with some literature advocating cutoff as high as 50mmHg or as low as 30mmHg.(Arnold and Perler 2019; Chia et al. 2020)\nEEG Neuromonitoring - EEG tech places neuromonitoring, monitored by the technician and neurologist remotely intraoperatively. Generally the surgeon should clamp the ICA for 3 minutes before proceeding, if the patient develops neurological deficit/EEG abnormalities with slowing and decreased alpha and beta waves, then unclamp, await normalization of EEG, then proceed.\nCerebral Oximetry - 15% decrease in either hemisphere should be shunted.\nTranscranial Doppler (TCD) - severe slowing in the middle cerebral artery. An RCT demonstrated that TCD and cerebral oximetry changes most accurately predicted cerebral ischemia. Detection of a greater than 50% drop in middle cerebral artery velocity using transcranial Doppler is 100% sensitive for detecting cerebral ischemia. (Moritz et al. 2007) For more see Section 20.3.\nNon-selective shunting - the surgeon uses a shunt for all CEAs as standard practice, this is often done for all CEAs performed under general anesthesia\n\nTechniques to reach high internal carotid lesions?(Beretta et al. 2006)\n\nA good knowledge of the available imaging while preparing for the procedure is essential when considering the level of the carotid bifurcation.\nNasotracheal intubation will allow for jaw closure and neck extension to facilitate exposure of higher lesions.\nDivision of the posterior belly of the digastric muscle, stylopharyngeal muscle, styloglossus muscle, stylomandibular ligament or the styloid process. Care should be taken to identify and preserve the glossopharyngeal nerve.\nDivision of the occipital artery.\nDissection along the posterior parotid gland.\nENT surgeon assisted mandible subluxation with assistance if previous techniques fail.\n\nWhat is the best technique for a patient with an anatomically kinked internal carotid artery?\n\nEversion carotid endarterectomy (only indication for selection for this technique over patch endarterectomy), transection allows for reduction of redundancy at re-anastamosis.\nOtherwise, no advantage has been shown between eversion or patch, both can be shunted.\n\nNerve Injuries – where you would encounter these and, if injured, what deficit would be seen?\n\nHypoglossal - Most commonly injured. Usually passes above the bifurcation of the carotid artery. If injured the tongue will deviate toward the side of injury on protrusion.\nGlossopharyngeal - Commonly injured during high dissections. Found under the posterior digastric muscle. Injury can be devastating for patients resulting in difficulty swallowing and high aspiration risk.\nVagus - Usually found adjacent and lateral to the common carotid. Injury can occur with carotid clamping. Patients develop hoarseness due to innervation of the laryngeal muscles from the recurrent laryngeal nerve which is a branch of the vagus.\nMarginal Mandibular - Branch of the facial nerve. Runs inferior to the angle of the mandible. Commonly a retraction injury during high dissections leading to the corner of the ipsilateral lip drooping, can be confused with a significant neurological deficit following the c ase.\n\nCompletion duplex for CEA\n\nCan identify technical issues with carotid endarterectomy such as clamp site injury, thrombosis, intimal flap or dissection, or missed disease.(Lipski et al. 1996)\n\nAcute thrombus may be hypoechoic and difficult to see on B-mode, color flow necessary to determine luminal narrowing or occlusion. For more see Section 20.2.\n\nRevision required if residual plaque identified with severe velocity elevation.(Weinstein et al. 2015)\n\nElevated velocities can be seen for many reasons that do not require revision, including incorrect technique (compression with probe), tortuosity, size discrepancy, ICA spasm.(Ricco et al. 2013; Weinstein et al. 2015)\n\nOne study demonstrated that 2.3% of carotids required revision for concerning findings on completion duplex ultrasound.(Ascher et al. 2004)\n\n\n\n\n1.4.3.3 Complications\n\nPost-operative stroke - What to do if the patient develops neuro deficits following carotid endarterectomy?\n\nTwo main concerns- an intimal flap causing thrombosis or an embolic event resulting in a stroke. Perform a thorough neurological exam to confirm in operated carotid territory.\nIf in OR – perform duplex, very low threshold to re-explore and confirm patency of ICA with duplex or doppler. If ICA open and concerned for distal embolization, then perform a cerebral angiogram and proceed with thrombolysis or thrombectomy.(Fletcher et al. 2016)\nIf in Recovery or on the floor – many would consider CTA first line vs duplex to look for thrombosis.\nESRD patients have higher rates of perioperative stroke, but also have higher rates of stroke if not revascularized. (Klarin et al. 2016)\n\nRisk factors and how to manage hyperperfusion syndrome?\n\nDefined as an ipsilateral headache, hypertension, neurological deficits likely in distribution of the carotid which can progress to seizures and intracranial hemorrhage (75-100% mortality). Can present 2-3 days post surgery.(Kaku, Yoshimura, and Kokuzawa 2004)\nPatients with uncontrolled hypertension are at risk for hyperperfusion syndrome, clinical practice guidelines from SVS recommend strict BP control following CEA, with target pressure being less than 140/80mmHg or 20mmHg from preoperative baseline.(Abou-Chebl et al. 2004; Aburahma and Perler 2022)\n\nCarotid artery patch infections\n\nRare complication (<1%) presenting as phlegmon, pseudoaneurysm, sinus tract or carotid cutaneous fistula.(Stone et al. 2011)\nTreatment is excision and replacement with autologous tissue.(Fatima et al. 2019)\n\n\n\n\n1.4.3.4 Outcomes and Surveillence\n\nRecommend follow up US duplex of bilateral carotids at 30 days. If stenosis >50% is identified, then further imaging is indicated.\nIpsilateral restenosis\n\n0-3mo likely due to inadequate endarterectomy or clamp injury.(Kang et al. 2014)\n1-3y likely neointimal hyperplasia, smooth and regular. If <80% stenosis and asymptomatic, then duplex surveillance and antiplatelet. If progresses, then often endo treatment first.(Garzon-Muvdi et al. 2016)\nRisk factors for restenosis include hyperlipidemia(LaMuraglia et al. 2005), female gender, primary closure without patch, younger age, and certain plaque characteristics-abundance of smooth muscle, absence of macrophages/lymphocytes, and lipid core <10%.(Hellings et al. 2008; Pauletto et al. 2000)\n\nContralateral stenosis:\n\nThe risk of progression for moderate stenosis at the initial surveillance to severe stenosis in the contralateral artery can be as high as 5 times.\nRequires post-operative surveillance.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4.4 Endovascular - Carotid Artery Stenting\n\n1.4.4.1 Indications\nLimited data is available on CAS in asymptomatic patients - currently is not supported by guidelines or considered reimbursable.\nConsider CAS in symptomatic patients with >50% stenosis who are poor candidates for CEA due to severe uncorrectable medical comorbidities and/or anatomic considerations\n\nIpsilateral neck dissection or XRT - equivalent periprocedural stroke rate to CEA, but increased later stroke rate. CEA higher rates of cranial nerve damage (9%). (Giannopoulos et al. 2018)\nContralateral vocal cord paralysis.\nLesions that extend proximally to the clavicle or distal to C2.\n\nIn patients aged >70 the risk of intra or post procedure stroke was the highest, if undergoing CAS, presumably due to calcified disease in the arch.\n\nLesion-specific characteristics are thought to increase the risk of cerebral vascular events after CAS and include a “soft” lipid-rich plaque identified on noninvasive imaging, extensive (15 mm or more) disease, a pre-occlusive lesion, and circumferential heavy calcification.\nThis risk can be reduced, but not eliminated, by using flow-reversal embolic protection rather than distal filter protection.\n\n\n\n1.4.4.2 Technique\nTransfemoral Approach vs Transcarotid approach\n\nROADSTER Trial - single arm study with flow reversal for cerebral protection. Suggested lower rates of post-op stroke in patients undergoing TCAR.\nTCAR contraindications include previous CCA intervention, CCA disease at entry site, <5cm CCA (clavicle to bifurcation) for sheath, CCA < 6mm, contralateral recurrent laryngeal or vagus nerve injury.(Kwolek et al. 2015)\nPatient needs to be preloaded with dual antiplatelet medications for at least 5-7d, should delay procedure if has not been appropriately loaded with antiplatelets.(Brott et al. 2010; Kwolek et al. 2015; Valls et al. 2017)\nStudies with TCD have shown that there may be reduced embolization rates with TCAR over transfemoral stenting.(Plessers et al. 2016)Complications\n\nPost stenting ICA thrombosis should first be treated with abciximab and catheter directed thrombolysis, followed by endo-salvage with suction thrombectomy, repeat angioplasty or stenting.

No clear difference between treatments in literature - PBA, Cutting, DBA, stenting, open conversion.(Arhuidese et al. 2017)\nRepeat angioplasty or stent have low incidence of periprocedural stroke but failed to improve long term stroke/death/MI or patency rates.(Chung et al. 2016)\n\n\n\n\n1.4.5 Summary of Prospective Trials\n\nAsymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study (ACAS)(Walker 1995)\n\nCompared medical management with CEA in asymptomatic patients with > 60% stenosis.\n5-year stroke and death rate was 5.1% vs 11%.\nIn women, the benefit of CEA was not as certain as 5y stroke and death rates were 7.3% vs. 8.7%.\nThis trial was conducted pre-statin and clopidogrel era.\n\nNorth American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) (North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial Collaborators 1991)\n\nCompared medical management vs CEA for symptomatic patients with moderate (50-69%) and severe stenosis (>70%)\nOnly moderate impact for patients with moderate stenosis (50-69%)\nSymptomatic patients with >70 % stenosis benefited from CEA, at 18 months 7% major stroke in surgical arm, and a 24% stroke rate in medical arm. 29% reduction in 5-year risk of stroke or death.\n\nPatients with severe >70% stenosis had such a dramatic effect the trial was stopped early for this subset and all referred for endarterectomy.\n\nNo benefit is shown in symptomatic patients with < 50% stenosis\nEuropean studies have shown similar results\n\nACST = ACAS\nECST = NASCET.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake a Listen\n\n\n\nCheck out our conversation with Dr. William Jordan where he discusses this landmark NASCET paper.\n\n\n\nCarotid Revascularization Endarterectomy versus Stenting Trial (CREST).(Silver et al. 2011)\n\nCompared CEA vs. CAS in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.\nComposite endpoint of 30-day stroke, MI, death equivalent between CEA and CAS.\nCAS had a significantly higher incidence of stroke and death than CEA and CEA higher incidence of MI.\n\nFollow up at 10 years demonstrated no difference in composite stroke/MI/death but increased rate of stroke/death in stented patients likely attributable to increased periprocedural stroke. (Brott et al. 2016)\nCAS patients with stroke had a higher impact on QOL than CEA patients with MI.(Brott et al. 2010; Redfern, Rodseth, and Biccard 2011; Mantese et al. 2010)\n\nSubanalyses identified that older patients (>70y) had better outcomes after CEA than CAS, the QOL impact of stroke was more significant than that of MI, and anatomic characteristics of carotid lesions (longer, sequential, remote) were predictive of increased stroke and death after CAS.(Voeks et al. 2011)\nUnfortunately, this study provides a benchmark to strive for, but no other large trials have achieved these results.\n\nROADSTER(Kwolek et al. 2015)\n\nSingle arm feasibility trial of transcarotid carotid stenting.\nThe results of the ROADSTER trial demonstrate that the use of the ENROUTE Transcarotid NPS is safe and effective at preventing stroke during CAS. The overall stroke rate of 1.4% is the lowest reported to date for any prospective, multicenter clinical trial of CAS (i.e. CREST). No direct comparison.\nRecent multi-institutional post market surveillance study demonstrated found TCAR outcomes to be “broadly similar” to carotid endarterectomy.(Kashyap et al. 2019)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake a Listen\n\n\n\nCheck out our conversation with Dr Jeffrey Jim where he discusses details of comparative effectiveness research and how it has been applied to TCAR."

    "text": "1.5 Uncommon Carotid Disease\n\n1.5.1 Complicated Extracranial Occlusive Disease\nOccluded Carotid: What is the management of an occluded carotid?\n\nLeave it alone.\n\nWhat if an occluded carotid on imaging is still causing TIAs?\n\nOngoing symptoms in the setting of carotid occlusion is known as carotid artery stump syndrome. Symptoms are likely due to emboli from friable intima of the internal carotid or from the external carotid through collaterals. Treatment is external carotid endarterectomy and ligation of the internal carotid.(Hrbáč et al. 2012)\nThe addition of oral anticoagulation is likely to reduce the rate of recurrent stroke.\n\nSimultaneous coronary and carotid disease\n\nPatients with symptomatic carotid stenosis (50-99%) will benefit from CEA before or concomitant with CABG. The timing of the intervention depends on the clinical presentation and institutional experience (grade 2C).(Aburahma and Perler 2022)\nPatients with severe bilateral asymptomatic carotid stenosis, including stenosis and contralateral occlusion, should be considered for CEA before or concomitant with CABG (grade 2C).(Aburahma and Perler 2022)\nPatients undergoing simultaneous CEA/CABG demonstrate highest mortality. (A. R. Naylor et al. 2003)\n\nWhat about tandem lesions in the carotid in a symptomatic patient, carotid bulb and carotid siphon lesion (high ICA)? How should you treat this?\n\nTreat carotid bulb and extracranial disease first, likely to be the embolic source.\nTreatment of intracranial disease has been shown to increase rates of stroke and death.(Chimowitz et al. 2011). Extracranial to intracranial bypass has increased risk of stroke over BMT.(Group 1985)\n\nWhat if the patient has severe vertebrobasilar insufficiency and carotid artery disease?\n\nShould undergo carotid revascularization first to improve flow. Then reassess for vertebrobasilar insufficiency.\nVertebrobasilar insufficiency characterized by dizziness, ataxia, nausea, vertigo and bilateral weakness. (Lima Neto et al. 2017a; Nouh, Remke, and Ruland 2014)\n\n\n\n1.5.2 Vertebrobasilar Disease\nMost common etiology is atherosclerosis, but can also be caused by embolism, dissection or migraines.(Lima Neto et al. 2017b)\nSymptomatic primary vertebral disease with >60% stenosis should be treated. Vertebral divided into segments. V1 preforaminal (lower than C6), V2 foraminal (C6-C2), V3 (C2-dura), V4 (intracranial).(Morasch 2019; Berguer, Morasch, and Kline 1998)\nDisease of V1 should be treated with vertebral transposition of bypass with vein.(Rangel-Castilla et al. 2015)\n\nMost common complication is Horner’s Syndrome due to disruption of the sympathetic chain (20%), next is TIA (1-3%).(Coleman et al. 2013; Ramirez et al. 2012)\n\nDisease of V2 is most difficult to access and should be treated with bypass from ICA to V3.(Berguer 1985)\nRCT of BMT vs endo treatment did not show superiority of endo treatment, recurrent symptoms most common, periprocedural stroke was rare.(Antoniou et al. 2012; Coward et al. 2007)\n\n\n1.5.3 Carotid artery dissection\nPatients with carotid dissection should be initially treated with antithrombotic therapy (antiplatelet agents or anticoagulation) (GRADE 1, Level of Evidence C).\nIndications for endovascular treatment of carotid artery dissection (Cohen et al. 2012; Markus et al. 2019; Pham et al. 2011)\n\nOngoing symptoms on best medical therapy\nContraindication to antithrombotics\nPseudoaneurysm\n\n\n\n1.5.4 Internal Carotid Artery Aneurysms\nDefined as dilation of the bulb 200% of the internal carotid artery or 150% of the common carotid artery. Like popliteal aneurysms the major risk is thromboembolization.(Bush, Long, and Atkins 2019; Fankhauser et al. 2015; Pourier et al. 2018)\nTreatment is resection with primary repair or interposition. Distorted anatomy increased the risk for cranial nerve injury (12%).(Welleweerd et al. 2015)\nRedundant ICA - should be repaired if patient symptomatic due to kinking. Treated with resection and primary repair with shortening and straightening.(Ballotta et al. 2005)\nFibromuscular Dysplasia (FMD)(Olin and Sealove 2011) - for more, see Section 12.3\n\nAsymptomatic disease can often be treated with antiplatelets alone.\nDuplex ultrasound demonstrates classic “chain of lakes” appearance. For more see Section 20.2\nAssociated with intracranial aneurysms (13%), therefore may be reasonable to also pursue brain imaging if identified. However, no formal guidelines exist.(Lather et al. 2017)\n\n\n\n1.5.5 Carotid Body Tumors (CBT)\n\n1.5.5.1 Demographics\nOne quarter (25%) are associated with a germline mutation or familial history. Genetic testing recommended in patients with multifocal tumors, associated paraganglioma, pheochromocytoma or family history. SDHD gene mutation is most common associated with familial paraganglioma.(Davila et al. 2016; Kruger et al. 2010)\nBlood supply primarily from the external carotid artery.(Robertson et al. 2019; Davila et al. 2016)\nShamblin criteria utilized to determine difficulty of resection and is associated with rates of carotid reconstruction or cranial nerve injury.(Chow, Moore, and Lamuraglia 2019; Shamblin et al. 1971)\n\nType 1 - abut but do not involve internal or external carotid arteries or cranial nerves can be easily dissected.\nType 2 - partially surround external carotid artery or cranial nerves and may be dissected free but risk injury to these structures.\nType 3 - fully surround either internal or external carotid artery or cranial nerves and pose a high risk of injury and need for reconstruction.\n\n\n\n1.5.5.2 Management\nRisk of injury or revascularization during resection determined by Shamblin criteria as discussed above. In patients with Shamblin Type 3 or with involvement of the internal carotid, these patients should be evaluated for carotid artery ligation.\n\nWhen involved with a CBT or other skull base tumors, cerebral perfusion should be thoroughly evaluated prior to surgical resection to determine whether a patient will tolerate carotid ligation.\nEvaluation includes balloon occlusion testing with xenon-enhanced SPECT imaging. Low risk for ligation if no neurologic deficits (after 30min and hypotensive challenge) and normal diffusion of SPECT (ratio of >0.9). Angiography with contralateral occlusion evaluates collaterals.(Sugawara et al., n.d.; Tansavatdi et al. 2015)\n\nEmbolization if tumor arterial inflow may help reduce risk of perioperative blood loss but is not associated with reduced cranial nerve injury. Resection should take place 24-36hrs after embolization.(Power et al. 2012)\n\n\n\n\nAbou-Chebl, Alex, Jay S Yadav, Joel P Reginelli, Christopher Bajzer, Deepak Bhatt, and Derk W Krieger. 2004. “Intracranial Hemorrhage and Hyperperfusion Syndrome Following Carotid Artery Stenting: Risk Factors, Prevention, and Treatment.” Journal of the American College of Cardiology 43 (9): 1596–1601. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacc.2003.12.039.\n\n\nAbuRahma, Ali F., Efthymios D.

Limitation in visualization of injury above the angle of the mandible (distal internal carotid and proximal thoracic outlet)\nThese imaging modalities are used to assess visibility of defect (i.e. dissection, thrombus, intimal flap) and degree of flow limitation by measured velocity.\n\nDenver Grading Scale for Blunt Vascular Carotid Injury (BCVI)(Biffl et al. 2001)\n\nGrade I: Luminal irregularity or dissection with < 25% luminal narrowing\nGrade II: Dissection or intraluminal hematoma with ≥ 25% luminal narrowing, intraluminal thrombus, or raised intimal flap\nGrade III: Pseudoaneurysm\nGrade IV: Occlusion\nGrade V: Transection with free extravasation\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Management\nConsiderations\n\nConsider the overall injury severity of the trauma patient with any concomitant injuries that may prevent antiplatelet/anticoagulation initiation (i.e. TBI) or intervention\n\nOftentimes have other blunt vascular injuries, such as aortic injuries, that need to be addressed as well\nCan consider delay of intervention (approx. 7 days) to decrease risk of neurological events\n\nIf there is a change in the neurological exam after initiation of medical management, considered as failure of medical therapy and surgical intervention is indicated\nIf unable to obtain a reliable neurological exam, can consider transcranial doppler or EEG if accessible, but is not mandatory\nContinue supportive measures to prevent secondary injuries, ie optimize cerebral perfusion pressure\nRepeat imaging with change in neurological status\nSerial imaging important in assessing whether injury has evolved\nEndovascular repair usually involves transfemoral approach for access with arch aortogram, selection of defective carotid vessel, and placement of the endovascular treatment (ie: stent graft, bare metal stent, coil embolization of pseudoaneurysm)\n\nCarotid Artery Injury Treatments\n\nGrade I and II injuries are recommended to be treated medically with antiplatelet/anticoagulation therapy if patient is able to tolerate\n\nRepeat CTA imaging in 5-7 days while inpatient to ensure that injury has not evolved in acute phase\nFollow-up CTA imaging within 1 month of discharge as outpatient to assess healing. Imaging needs to be continued until there is resolution of lesion.\nGrade I lesions typically improve over time, Grade II lesions or higher have a greater chance of evolving (approximately 60%)\n\nAccessible Grade III and V carotid injuries should be repaired.\n\nGrade III pseudoaneurysms should be repaired endovascularly with a covered stent (ie stent graft that covers the opening of the pseudoaneurysm) or bare metal stent (maintains integrity of the wall). Through these stents, coils can be placed to thrombose the pseudoaneurysm. Flow needs to be maintained.\nOpen approach can be considered for Zone II injuries\n\nGrade I and IV carotid injuries, and inaccessible Grade II and III carotid injuries should be treated with medical management (antiplatelet/anticoagulation)\n\nGrade IV injuries without associated injuries that preclude use of anticoagulation, would heparinize and proceed with anticoagulation (avoid bolus of heparin, goal PTT 50-70 within first 24 hours). Monitor for bleeding. Transition to oral anticoagulant for 30-90 days.\nGrade IV injuries with contraindications for anticoagulation, would recommend dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and clopidogrel)\nOverall, anticoagulation is preferred if there are no contraindications. If there are, then dual antiplatelet therapy is preferred.\n\nGrade V and persistent Grade III should be repaired surgically\n\nVertebral Artery Injury Treatments\n\nSpecial Considerations\n\nAttempt to determine whether the dominant or diminutive vertebral artery is involved\nTreatment is again based on severity with grading system (Denver Grading Scale), consider location and extent\nConsider any associations with a basilar artery defect or posterior circulation stroke\nGrade I-IV vertebral injuries should be treated with medical management as first line, approximately 90% self-resolve\nEndovascular interventions can be considered for those patients with severe injury and/or who are symptomatic\n\nUsually performed by neuro-interventionalist as the injury is located within the skull base\n\nSerial imaging still needs to be performed to evaluate healing (similar manner to carotid injury)\nIn the setting of trauma, if there is an expanding hematoma due to vertebral artery injury and open approach is performed to control bleeding, vertebral artery is usually ligated in this scenario\n\nVertebral reconstructions are not well-suited for traumas\n\n\n\nGuidelines and treatment algorithm can be found here(Geddes et al. 2016)"

    "text": "3.1 Overview\n\n3.1.1 Anatomy\nWhat are the zones of the upper extremity?(Illig 2019)\nDivision of the upper extremity into three zones:\n\nIntrathoracic Zone: Inclusive of the aortic arch and its branches, innominate artery (dividing into right subclavian and right common carotid), left subclavian artery and left common carotid artery, as well as the innominate veins, and SVC.\n\nArch classification helps determine difficulty of accessing the right innominate from a femoral approach. Type 1 innominate does not break the plane of the outer curve, Type 2 it is between the outer curve and inner curve and Type 3 it falls below the inner curve of the aortic arch.\n\nThoracic Outlet: Extends from the base of neck to the axilla. Includes the subclavian, proximal vertebral, and proximal axillary arteries, as well as the corresponding veins).\nAxilla to Fingers: The arm.\n\nWhat are some common exposures for major upper extremity arteries?(Illig 2019; Gary G Wind and R. James Valentine 2013)\n\nProximal Right Subclavian Artery: Access through a median sternotomy.\nProximal Left Subclavian Artery: An anterolateral thoracotomy is required in emergent settings for proximal left subclavian artery control.\n\nFor proximal, mid and distal exposure is required a “trap door” exposure is used which is a combined anterolateral thoracotomy, third space sternotomy, and left supraclavicular incision.\n\nMid and Distal Subclavian Artery: Access through a supraclavicular Incision. After division of the platysma and clavicular head of the SCM, a fat pat of varying thickness is encountered which contains the omohyoid muscle.\n\nThis should be divided and placed supero-laterally. At this point, the anterior scalene muscle is exposed medially with the phrenic nerve running in a lateral to medial direction, which should be identified and preserved.\nIn a carotid/subclavian bypass division of the anterior scalene should be performed as close to the first rib as possible. Once divided the subclavian artery is exposed.\n\nAxillary Artery: Exposure is gained through an infraclavicular incision, below the middle third of the clavicle.\n\nPectoralis major is divided and pectoralis minor is freed at the lateral margin of the wound. The axillary vein should be identified and followed supero-deeply to identify and expose the artery. Anatomically bound by the first rib proximally and the lateral edge of the teres major muscle distally.\nFor exposure of the first part of the axillary artery, the ipsilateral arm is abducted approximately 90 degrees and a horizontal skin incision 2 cm below the middle third of the clavicle should be made. The underlying pectoralis major is split by bluntly separating the fibers, exposing the tough clavipectoral fascia. At the lateral wound margin, the pectoralis minor can be freed and laterally retracted.\nThe axillary vein is the first structure to be encountered in the fascia and the artery lies just superior and deep to the vein. Make sure to protect the nerves of the brachial plexus which lie deep to the first part of axillary artery and are at risk of injury during blind placement of occluding arterial clamps.\n\nBrachial Artery, Upper Arm: The brachial artery’s superficial location makes it vulnerable to injury and accounts for most vascular injuries of the upper extremities.\n\nBrachial artery exposure involves a 5-8 cm longitudinal incision in the groove between the biceps/triceps muscles on the medial aspect of the arm. In the lower half of the arm, take care to avoid basilic vein damage as it runs in the subcutaneous tissue.\nThe neurovascular bundle is exposed by incising the deep fascia at the medial border of the biceps muscle, which then should be retracted anteriorly. The basilic vein should be identified and retracted into the posterior wound.\nOn opening the brachial sheath the median nerve is the most superficial structure and should be identified, protected and retracted. The brachial artery lies deep to the median nerve and is flanked by two brachial veins. Be mindful that the ulnar nerve lies posteriorly.\n\nBrachial Artery, Antecubital Fossa: Exposure of the brachial artery in the antecubital fossa requires a transverse skin incision 1 cm distal to the midpoint of the antecubital crease.\n\nAfter deepening, mobilize the basilic vein medially to avoid injury. The medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve should be identified and protected. The bicipital aponeurosis should be divided to exposure the brachial artery, which is flanked by two deep veins crossing tributaries.\nTo isolate the brachial artery ligation and division of these tributaries is required. The brachial artery bifurcates at the radial tuberosity into its radial and ulnar branches.\nImmediately after the ulnar artery arises from the bifurcation origin, it gives off a short common interosseous branch, which bifurcates at the hiatus in the proximal interosseous membrane.\n\nRadial Artery at the Wrist: This requires a 2-3 cm longitudinal incision generally between the palpable radial artery and cephalic vein.\n\nIncision of the antebrachial fascia medially to the radius should expose the radial artery. Two veins accompany the artery and should be dissected away to isolate the artery.\nThe superficial radial nerve and its medial/lateral branches course between the cephalic vein and radial artery in this area.\n\nUlnar Artery: The ulnar artery courses beneath the superficial flexor muscles of the proximal forearm, emerging near the ulnar border at the midpoint between the elbow and the wrist.\n\nIn the distal forearm, the ulnar artery runs just deep to the antebrachial fascia and is easily exposed through a longitudinal incision placed radially to the flexor carpi ulnaris.\nThe palmar branch of the ulnar nerve courses superficially to the antebrachial fascia and should be preserved during arterial exposure to avoid injury.\n\n\nWhat common aberrant upper extremity/arch anatomy is important to be aware of?\n\nBovine Arch: Where the innominate and left common carotid arteries share a common origin.(Layton et al. 2006)\nAberrant Vertebral Artery: Where the vertebral artery arises directly from the aortic arch.\nAberrant Right Subclavian Artery: Where there is no innominate artery and instead the right common carotid arises directly from the aorta.\n\nConfusingly the right subclavian artery, then originates from the aortic arch distal to the left subclavian artery.\nTo supply the right arm it therefore, needs to pass behind the esophagus.\n\n\nOf note, thoracic aortic disease is associated with aberrant anatomy, with high rates of bovine arch (25%), isolated L vertebral (6-8%), and aberrant R subclavian (1-2%).(Dumfarth et al. 2015)\n\n\n3.1.2 Etiology\nHow does evaluation of upper extremity ischemia differentiate from lower extremity ischemia?\nUpper extremity ischemia <5% of patients with limb ischemia are a result of underlying atherosclerosis, which is in contrast to lower extremity.(Shuja 2019)\nVast majority of cases caused by embolic, autoimmune, or connective tissue disorders.\nHow can upper extremity disease be classified?\nAnatomic Location:\n\nLarge vs. Small Vessel\n\nDisease Process:\n\nVaso-occlusive disease often requires endovascular/surgical management.\nVasospastic disease is more responsive to pharmacological management.\n\n\n\n3.1.3 Evaluation\nHow should patients be evaluated who have concern for upper extremity disease?\n\nDetailed H+P evaluation (pulse palpation, auscultation at supraclavicular/infraclavicular fossa may reveal a bruit concerning for subclavian artery stenosis, upper extremity neurovascular/skin exam)\nBrachial/forearm blood pressures and if suspected claudication, measured at rest and 2-5 minutes after exercise. Look for a gradient of >20 mmHg is considered significant\nSome or all of 6 P’s of acute limb ischemia with symptoms occurring within 14 days are deemed acute\nDoppler insonation of radial, ulnar, palmar, and digital arteries\nVascular Lab Evaluation\n\nSegmental Pressure Measurements\nDuplex Ultrasound (look for large vessel occlusive disease)\n\nOther Imaging\n\nCTA/MRA\n\nClinical Lab tests\n\nInflammatory disorders-CBC, ESR, CRP, ANA, RF\nHypercoagulable screening"

Mitchell 2020)\nEtiology: Atherosclerosis is the most common cause of subclavian/axillary occlusive disease. Left SCA > Right involvement. Less common causes include Takayasu disease, giant cell arteritis, or arterial TOS\nSymptoms: Upper extremity arm/hand ischemia or neurologic symptoms due to subclavian-vertebral steal.\n\nBecause significant collaterals, minimal pain on exertion even with subclavian occlusion.\nInnominate disease can present with complex steal syndrome from the vertebral artery.(Rodriguez 2016)\n\nWhat are causes and symptoms associated with brachial/forearm occlusive disease?\nEtiology: MCC of brachial artery occlusion is cardiac origin embolus.\n\nAtherosclerosis RARELY affects the brachial artery. Forearm occlusive disease can be seen in advanced ESRD or DM where calcific atherosclerosis of radial/ulnar arteries is present.\nDistal axillary/proximal brachial stenosis can be from repetitive trauma from crutch use.\nRadiation arteritis - may be seen with radiation after breast cancer therapy. Lesions characteristically tapered with smooth border. May occur alongside a brachial plexopathy.(Goldstein et al. 2010; Modrall and Sadjadi 2003)\nLess common causes include Buerger’s disease or Raynaud Phenomenon\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Management\n\n3.2.2.1 Chronic Limb Threatening Ischemia\nHow/when is upper extremity occlusive disease treated?\nIndications for treatment\n\n70% stenosis and associated symptoms or deficit\nLesion with ipsilateral ICA requiring treatment\nPre-occlusive lesion in a good surgical candidate (>5y life expectancy)\n\nInnominate or SCA Occlusive Disease\n\nEndovascular with balloon expandable stent via femoral or ipsilateral brachial artery. (Chatterjee et al. 2013; Bradaric et al. 2015; Saha et al. 2017; Palchik et al. 2008; Mordasini et al. 2011) Preferred in:\n\nShort segment or ostial disease with adequate distance to the vertebral artery origin.\nHistory of neck surgery or radiation.\n\nSurgery:\n\nBypass from aortic arch through median sternotomy - Most durable option, particularly for dense R innominate disease, so preferred in patients who can tolerate.\n\nEndarterectomy not appropriate if disease involves the origin.(Aiello and Morrissey 2011; Mansukhani et al. 2018; Berguer, Morasch, and Kline 1998; Daniel et al. 2014; Reul et al. 1991; Berguer et al. 1999; Byrne et al. 2007)\nComplications include compression of the graft on sternal closure, so proximal anastomosis should be placed to the side of the aorta.\n\nIpsilateral CCA to subclavian artery (bypass or transposition) - Recent NSQIP study showed no difference in stroke and death for CS bypass vs transposition, therefore procedure should be determined by anatomic constraints.(Cinà et al. 2002; Vliet et al. 1995) Small studies and systematic reviews have shown that patency of carotid subclavian bypass is better with synthetic graft than with autologous vein.(AbuRahma, Robinson, and Jennings 2000; Illuminati et al. 2018; Ziomek et al. 1986)\n\nAn additional indication for carotid subclavian bypass is as a staged revascularization prior to TEVAR for aneurysmal disease requiring coverage of the LSA\nHow does the exposure differentiate in transposition vs bypass?\n\nArterial transposition via a short, transverse cervical incision above the clavicle between two heads of SCM (bypass is lateral to entire SCM)\nSub-platysmal flaps created and avoid EJ vein damage\nOmohypoid divided between heads of SCM and IJ mobilized laterally (bypass IJ is mobilized medially to expose CCA and care must be taken to avoid phrenic nerve in more lateral approach)\nCCA is reflected medially with vagus nerve\nOn the left side, the thoracic duct is identifiable and divided followed by dividing the vertebral vein\nSubclavian artery and proximal branches identified (anterior scalene is in lateral dissection)\n\nWhat are some common complications after carotid subclavian bypass in order of highest to lowest incidence?\n\nPhrenic nerve palsy (most common) - most often managed conservatively.\nRecurrent laryngeal palsy\nLymphatic leak, seen more on the L with thoracic duct injury\nNeck hematoma(Voigt et al. 2019)\n\nWhen carotid-subclavian bypass compared to transposition?\n\nVertebral artery takes origin from the subclavian artery in a very proximal position or is dominant over the contralateral side, then bypass preferred. (Morasch 2009)\nFor coronary-subclavian steal with patent internal mammary artery to coronary artery bypass graft, then bypass (a carotid-subclavian transposition requires a more proximal clamp with occlusion of inline antegrade flow to the coronary bypass during the procedure) (Cua et al. 2017)\n\n\nContralateral CCA bypass with anterior or retropharyngeal tunneling.\n\n\nBrachial/forearm Occlusive disease\nEndovascular: PTA evidence is anecdotal with stents for lesions unresponsive to PTA or dissection following angioplasty.(Cheun et al. 2019; Nasser et al. 2014; Dineen, Smith, and Arko 2007)\nSurgery: GSV vein bypass remains standard for revascularization with bypasses to superficial or deep palmar arch have good patency rates. Tunneling is subcutaneous if to distal ulnar or superficial palmar arch whereas anatomical to distal radial artery over the anatomic snuffbox.(Chang et al. 2003; Masden, Seruya, and Higgins 2012; Spinelli et al. 2010)\n\n\n3.2.2.2 Acute Limb Ischemia\nWhat is the procedure of choice in acute limb ischemia of the upper extremity?\nWith acute presentation of upper limb ischemia and a localizing examination, may be reasonable to proceed directly to OR for embolectomy to minimize ischemia time.(Wahlberg, Goldstone, and Olofsson 2006; Henke 2009)\nWhat are some postoperative complications of an embolectomy for acute limb ischemia?\nBrachial sheath hematoma - parasthesias and weakness in the median nerve distribution require emergent re-exploration and decompression. Even small hematomas that are not readily identifiable on clinical exam, can cause compression on the median nerve and are a surgical emergency.(D. D. Tran and Andersen 2011)\nCompartment Syndrome - If prolonged ischemia or no hematoma found, and forearm compartments appear tense, then should proceed with fasciotomies to treat forearm compartment syndrome. Rarely performed prophylactically due to significant morbidity.(Gelberman et al. 1981; Kistler, Ilyas, and Thoder 2018; Leversedge et al. 2011)\n\nThree compartments - forearm volar (flexor, superficial, and deep), mobile wad (lateral), and dorsal (extensor, superficial, and deep). Volar compartments most susceptible to ischemia and compartment syndrome, most vulnerable muscle are flexor digitorum profundas and flexor pollicus longus.(Ronel, Mtui, and Nolan 2004)\nVolar/Henry approach decompresses lateral and volar compartments with a single incision, includes carpal tunnel release."

    "text": "3.3 Vasospastic Disorders\n\n3.3.1 Iatrogenic or Vasopressor Induced Ischemia\nYou are called to the intensive care unit for a septic patient with acute bilateral upper limb ischemia, what is the management strategy?\nCritically ill patients on vasopressors with bilateral upper extremity ischemia are often managed best with supportive measures and attempts to wean vasopressors (especially norepinephrine).(Gregory J. Landry et al. 2018)\nLimited role for radial artery embolectomy, only in clear ischemia isolated to the distribution of an occluded radial artery, often secondary to line placement.(Valentine, Modrall, and Clagett 2005)\n\n\n3.3.2 Raynaud’s Phenomenon\nWhat is Raynaud’s and what causes it?\nExaggeration of normal physiologic response with episodic pallor or cyanosis of the fingers caused by small digital artery vasoconstriction occurring in response to cold or emotional stress. There is an abnormality with sympathetic nervous system, resulting in a multifactorial problem involving a combination of vascular, neural, and humoral factors.(Shuja 2019; Gregory J. Landry 2019)\nWhat are the subtypes of Raynaud’s phenomenon and what is the underlying pathology?\n\nPrimary: Raynaud’s disease-idiopathic form that is a benign process not associated with structural vascular change. Triggers include (cold, emotional stress, caffeine) resulting in digital smooth muscle contraction and temporary digital hypoperfusion.\nSecondary: Fixed vascular obstruction to blood flow decreasing threshold for cold induced vasospasm or progress to tissue loss. Diseases associated include mixed connective tissue disease, SLE, and rheumatoid arthritis, and scleroderma (accounts for 80-90% of cases). In setting of lower digital blood pressure, symptomatic digital ischemia or tissue loss under low stress conditions. With cold/emotional stress, vasoconstrictive response of digital artery smooth muscle further causes arterial closure and resultant symptoms\n\nWhat are diagnostic criteria for Raynaud’s?\n\nClinical (Progression of ischemia with white -> blue -> red finger discoloration. Episodes can be self-limited and may last from less than a minute, but generally not longer than 10-20 minutes\nQualitative testing for severity of cold sensitivity in Raynaud’s syndrome can be useful. Most basic test is cold sensitivity and recovery after ice water immersion. >10 minutes return to baseline pressure concerning for Raynaud’s\nSegmental pressures with finger systolic blood pressure can differentiate purely vasospastic vs occlusive disease. Difference of more than 15 mm Hg between fingers or absolute finger pressure <70 mm Hg may indicate occlusive disease\nSerologic evaluation (ANA/RF)\n\nWhat are appropriate treatments for Raynaud’s phenomenon?\n\nMedical-cold/tobacco avoidance lead to improvement in around half of patients. Calcium channel blocker (nifedipine ER 30mg qday) and losartan (50mg BID) have been shown to be most effective.(Gregory J. Landry 2013; Wigley and Flavahan 2016) Other drugs include alpha blocker, sildenafil, fluoxetine (SSRI), reserpine, cilostazol, captopril.\n\nOUTCOMES ARE POOR IN PATIENTS WITH ARTERIAL OBSTRUCTION. If there is an asymmetric vascular examination, then further non-invasive vascular imaging is needed.\n\nSurgical-thoracic sympathectomy (used for treatment of digital artery vasospasm/digital ischemic ulceration). For vasospasm, thoracic sympathectomy is initially successful, but symptoms return generally within 3-6 months.\nImmunosuppression/immunomodulation for connective tissue disorders associated with secondary Raynaud phenomenon\n\nSee Landry’s Review in JVS for a good treatment algorithm.(Gregory J. Landry 2013)\n\n\n3.3.3 Ergotism\nWhat is Ergotism?\nErgot is a parasitic fungal disease that has a particular prevalence for infecting rye plants and ergot alkaloids have been linked to epidemic poisonings that manifested as ergotism from consumption of rye. Modern day is rare.(Stanley, Veith, and Wakefield 2014)\nWhat causes Ergotism and how do patients present?\n\nErgotamine is chemically like endogenous catecholamines/indolamines and when applied clinically, it behaves as an agonist to alpha-adrenergic, sertoninergic, and dopaminergic receptors. Can be seen with ergot alkaloid migraine medications. Despite limited bioavailability, vasocontrictive effects have been reported to last for 24 hours or longer\nGangrenous-mild limb pain followed by burning pain/shooting and\nConvulsive-heaviness in limbs and head associated with diarrhea. Could result in tonic-clonic spasms\n\nHow can you diagnose Ergotism and what is the process for treating this disease?\nUpper extremity ischemia (i.e. digital ulceration) in the setting of ergot alkaloid use (typically for migraines). The treatment includes:\n\nVolume expansion and IV heparin as anticoagulation\nIV infusion of nitroprusside, nitroglycerin, iloprost or combination\nInfusion of Ca 2+ channel blockers\nSurgical: for thrombosis, consider thrombolysis. Avoid or delay amputations as much as possible to maximize amount of tissue recovery.\n\n\n\n3.3.4 Buerger’s Disease\nHow is Buerger’s disease categorized?\nNon-atherosclerotic, segmental, inflammatory disease of small/medium sized arteries in distal extremities (upper and lower) of tobacco users distinct from either atherosclerosis of immune arteritis(Jack L Cronenwett, Alik Farber, and Erica L. Mitchell 2020; Le Joncour et al. 2018)\nWhat clinical criteria can help diagnose Buerger’s?\nDiagnosis of Buerger’s disease requires 5 criteria(Akar 2019)\n\nSmoking history\nOnset before age 45 or 50\nDistal extremity ischemia with infrapopliteal arterial occlusions and often upper limb involvement\nClassic angiographic findings of segmental occlusions of distal arteries with corkscrew collaterals\nAbsence of atherosclerotic risk factors (besides smoking, of course), autoimmune disease, diabetes or proximal embolic source.\n\nAlthough rarely are biopsy sent, pathology will show panvasculitis within small and medium-sized arteries, highly cellular intraluminal thrombus (contains CD68, Cd3, Cd8 inflammatory cells), preserved elastic lamina structure, unlike atherosclerotic lesions.(Akar 2019; Kobayashi et al. 1999)\nWhat is important about diagnosing Buerger’s\n\nTypically a diagnosis of exclusion\nMust rule out proximal embolic source, trauma, local lesions (e.g. pop entrapment or cystic adventitial disease), autoimmune disease, hypercoagulable status, atherosclerosis\n\nWhat physical exam and non-invasive/invasive imaging findings of Buerger’s?\n\nDistal, but not proximal arterial disease (palpable brachial/popliteal but absent/reduced at ankle or wrist)\nDigital brachial index (DBI) <0.6 and flat/reduced digital waveforms\nCTA/MRA/DSA or duplex - characteristic findings of serpiginous/corkscrew collaterals, occlusion of distal calf/pedal arteries, and normal proximal arteries.(Busch 2011; Fujii et al. 2011)\n\nWhat is the mainstay treatment in Buerger’s disease?\n\nSmoking cessation! Only treatment to improve symptoms and reduce amputation risk if achieved before onset of gangrene or tissue loss. May even require inpatient admission for intensive smoking cessation therapy.(Hooten, Bruns, and Hays 1998) It is important to remember following treatments will likely fail without smoking cessation.(J. W. Olin 2000)\nIf smoking cessation does not improve, medical management with antiplatelet agents, immunomodulators, vasodilators (Calcium channel blockers and cilostazol(Dean and Satiani 2001)), anticoagulants(Kubota et al. 1997), and IPC.(Montori et al. 2002)\nEndovascular-distal small vessel intervention\nSurgical-upper extremity autogenous vein bypass-limited success due to poor outflow\nSometimes can consider upper extremity sympathectomy, but unproven benefit\nAmputation-reported in 30-40% who are followed longer than 5 years(Jeffrey W. Olin 2018)\n\n\n\n3.3.5 Large Artery Vasculitis\nWhat are common characteristics for patients who are suspected to have a large vessel vasculitis? (Shanmugam 2019; Weyand and Goronzy 2003)\n\nAffect aorta and major branches\nPresent with non-specific heterogenous symptoms making the diagnosis challenging. Most commonly, they present with systemic or constitutional symptoms (fatigue, fever, weight loss, arthralgias)\nFrequently, diagnosis made with presence of constitutional symptoms, elevated inflammatory markers (ESR/CRP), and dedicated imaging (MRA, CTA, DUS, or PET)\n\nHow can you differentiate Takayasu arteritis vs giant cell arteritis?\n\n3.3.5.1 Takayasu arteritis\n\nInvolves aorta and major arch branches(Ehlert and Abularrage 2019)\nYoung patients (20-40 years) and female in 80-90% of cases, Asian populations\nAmerican College of Rheumatology (ACR) Criteria(Maz et al. 2021)\n\nOnset <40 years\nClaudication of an upper extremity\nDecreased brachial pulse\n>10 mmHg SBP between arms\nBruit over subclavian arteries or aorta\nArteriographic evidence of narrowing/occlusion in aorta/primary branches/or large upper/lower extremity arteries\n\n\n\n\n3.3.5.2 Giant cell arteritis\n\nAorta and main branches, but predilection for carotid artery branches(Bongartz and Matteson 2006)\nDiagnosis:\n\nAge at disease onset > 50 years\nNew headache\nTemporal artery abnormality\nElevated ESR (>50) - can be normal in up to a quarter of cases.\nAbnormal (temporal) artery biopsy (gold standard test)\n\nOther symptoms include jaw pain with mastication or visual changes\nAssociated with Polymyalgia rheumatic, characterized by morning stiffness in shoulders/hips occurring in 40-50% of patients.(Weyand and Goronzy 2014)\nArteriography/MRA/CTA/PET may be used to assess large vessel involvement - classic finding is smooth, tapering stenosis.\n\n\n\n3.3.5.3 Management\nWhat is the medical treatment for GCA and when do you consider surgical treatment?\nMedical-steroid therapy - In as many as 50% of patients who have a large vessel vasculitis refractory to glucocorticoid therapy alone, patients will trial immunomodulators or cytotoxic trugs (i.e. methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate, tocilizumab, or leflunomide)\nIntervention - Avoid intervention in the acute setting. Once in remission, treatment of symptomatic arterial lesions or those at aneurysm size threshold should be considered and as many as 50-70% with large vessel vasculitis will require intervention.\n\nEndovascular - angioplasty/stent/stent graft for large vessel vasculitis have all been described, however higher restenosis in endovascular compared to open treatment\nOpen Surgery (gold standard) - lesions are long, fibrotic and therefore less amenable to endovascular treatment. Bypass grafts from aorta-CCA are the most common (CEA should be avoid due to pathology involved)\n\nUpper extremity bypass with autogenous vein to the brachial artery\nAortic aneurysms should be managed with open surgery(Janssen et al. 2008)\nMid aortic syndrome likely needs open repair from uninvolved aorta-usually thoracic aorta-to bifurcation bypass with jump graft to involved visceral vessels.(Ehlert and Abularrage 2019)\n\n\n\n\n3.3.5.4 Surveillance\nHow should patients be monitored with active large artery vasculitis?\n\nLab data tracked at least monthly for 6 months with close follow-up to ensure appropriate response to medical treatment and enable physicians to assess for adverse effects of medical treatment\nRepeat tests after remission reached and imaging choice to evaluate large vessels (DUS/CTA/MRA)\n\n\n\n\n3.3.6 Other Vasculitis syndromes\nPolyarteritis Nodosum - Focal necrotizing lesions primarily affecting medium-sized muscular arteries, peak incidence in 40s. Multiple saccular aneurysms secondary to inflammatory destruction of vessel media.(Shanmugam 2019; Weyand and Goronzy 2003)\nBehçet Disease - recurrent oral pathos ulcers, genital ulcers and uveitis.(Shanmugam 2019; Weyand and Goronzy 2003)"

(Baig and Timaran 2019)\nEtiology\n\nDegenerative - atherosclerotic or due to aberrant right subclavian with degenerative changes in proximal subclavian known as “Kommerell diverticulum”(Tanaka, Milner, and Ota 2015)\nTraumatic - blunt, penetrating, iatrogenic with attempted catheter placement\nRadiation induced, sometimes seen after radiation for breast cancer.(Mohan et al. 2016)\nThoracic outlet obstruction - no need to investigate for aTOS if there is another plausible cause.\n\nPresentation\n\nRare, comprises 1% of peripheral aneurysms.\nExam-pulsatile supraclavicular mass or bruit, absent/diminished pulses, signs of microembolization (“blue finger”)\nMost discovered incidentally, however referred chest, neck, shoulder pain, upper extremity ischemia due to thrombosis or distal embolism, brachial plexus compression, hoarseness from right recurrent laryngeal nerve compression\nDysphagia from esophageal compression in aberrant right subclavian artery.(Tanaka, Milner, and Ota 2015)\nRarely rupture\n\nEvaluation\nWhat are diagnostic studies and treatment modalities for subclavian aneurysms?\n\nCXR-mediastinal mass may suggest neoplasm\nMRA/CTA important to delineate extent of aneurysm and proximity to ipsilateral vertebral artery\n\nManagement\n\nOpen Repair-resection/endoaneurysmorrhaphy with end to end (small aneurysms) or interposition prosthetic graft(Vierhout et al. 2010)\n\nProximal-median sternotomy with supraclavicular fossa extension for adequate proximal control for right side, however supraclavicular with left anterolateral thoracotomy for left subclavian aneurysm\nMid-Distal-supraclavicular/infraclavicular generally adequate for control where again resection of the clavicle may be needed\n\nEndovascular Repair-transbrachial/transfemoral approach with covered stent(Maskanakis et al. 2018)\n\nMust consider vertebral artery origin. Can cover vertebral artery if contralateral vertebral artery is patent and of adequate size, however posterior circulation stroke may occur when the contralateral vertebral artery is highly stenotic, hypoplastic or occluded.\n\nHybrid Repair-embolization/coils of proximal subclavian artery combined with subclavian transposition or carotid-subclavian bypass\nFor aberrant subclavian artery aneurysm, resection or exclusion of the aneurysmal artery with vascular reconstruction of the subclavian artery is recommended. Especially in the setting of dysphagia lusoria, subclavian artery reconstructed by interposition graft where proximal anastomosis is on ascending aorta. Alternatively, left posterolateral thoracotomy for proximal aneurysm resection and right supraclavicular incision for reconstruction of subclavian artery by end to side to the right CCA has been reported.(Tanaka, Milner, and Ota 2015)\n\n\n\n3.4.2 Axillary Artery Aneurysms\nHow are axillary aneurysms caused and how can they present?\nEtiology\n\nBlunt/penetrating trauma\nCongenital (infrequently reported)\nPost-traumatic axillary aneurysms (repeated abduction/external rotation downward toward humeral head in baseball pitchers)\n\nPresentation\n\nExam-pulsatile supraclavicular mass or bruit, absent/diminished pulses, signs of microembolization (“blue finger”)\n\nWhat are diagnostic studies and treatment modalities for axillary aneurysms?\nEvaluation\n\nUltrasound\nCTA/MRA of upper extremity\n\nManagement\n\nOpen Repair-resection with interposition vein grafting or prosthetic if inadequate vein is present.\nEndovascular repair-covered stent graft can be placed with occasional embolization with micro coils to isolate sac and prevent retrograde endoleaks\n\n\n\n3.4.3 Brachial Artery Aneurysms\nHow are brachial aneurysms caused and how can they present?\nEtiology\n\nFalse aneurysms secondary to repetitive trauma\nIatrogenic complications - Seen in 1-3% of brachial artery access - increased risk in older age, female patients, and larger sheaths.(Treitl et al. 2015) More on appropriate access technique can be found in Chapter 21\nIV drug abuse - infected pseudoaneurysms in antecubital fossa.\nConnective tissue disorders (ex. type IV Ehlers Danlos)\n\nPresentation\n\nExam: pulsatile mass\nLocal pain or symptoms of median nerve compression\nHand/digital ischemia from thrombosis/distal embolization\n\nWhat are diagnostic studies and treatment modalities for brachial aneurysms?\nEvaluation\n\nDuplex Ultrasound\nCTA/MRA of upper extremity may be needed to delineate extent of aneurysm\n\nManagement\n\nOpen Repair (preferred)-resection with patch or interposition vein grafting\nEndovascular repair-rare and generally in a traumatic setting\nIatrogenic injuries-due to access and nonoperative treatment for small/asymptomatic pseudoaneurysms that are likely to thrombose spontaneously. Direct suture repair with evacuation of hematoma is possible. Thrombin injection is less favorable due to location and short neck.\nNeurological symptoms from median nerve compression require an urgent repair, open surgery best for decompression.\n\n\n\n3.4.4 Radial Artery Pseudoaneurysm\nHow do you manage a patient who presents with a radial artery pseudoaneurysm after a coronary angiogram on year ago?\nSmall pseudoaneurysms <3cm have a high rate of spontaneous thrombosis. However, larger psuedoaneurysms or those with symptoms require treatment. Often best managed with open excision and primary repair or interposition graft.(Tosti et al. 2017)\nCan also be seen as a result of trauma.(Bagir, Sayit, and Tanrivermis Sayit 2017)"

    "text": "4.1 Overview\n\n4.1.1 Demographics\nThoracic Outlet Syndrome (TOS) is a constellation of signs and symptoms relating to the compression of the neurovascular structures that occurs as these structures travel between the thoracic aperture and the upper limb.\nTypes: Neurogenic, Venous and Arterial\n\nvTOS – 2-3%\naTOS – 1%\nnTOS – >95% (Humphries and Freischlag 2019b)\n\n\n4.1.1.1 Anatomy\nUnderstanding the anatomy of what is collectively referred to as the thoracic outlet is the best way to thoroughly appreciate this topic.\nAnatomy from anterior to posterior\n\nSubclavian vein\nPhrenic nerve\nAnterior scalene muscle attachment to the first rib\nThe subclavian artery\nThe brachial plexus\nThe middle scalene muscle\n\nThree spaces where the neurovascular structures are at risk of compression\n\nInterscalene Triangle - Appreciating the attachments of the Anterior and Middle Scalene Muscles on the first rib becomes important in the diagnosis of the various types and also the ultimate surgical management of the compression.\n\nAnterior Scalene - Attachments: Anterior Tubercles of the four ‘typical’ cervical vertebrae (3-6) AND the scalene tubercle on the upper surface of the first rib.\n\nPhrenic nerve runs along anterior scalene muscle and injury can cause ipsilateral diaphragm paralysis.\n\nMiddle Scalene - Attachments: The posterior tubercles and intertubercular lamellae of all the cervical vertebrae AND the Quadrangular area between the neck and subclavian groove of the first rib. (McMinn 2019)\n\nLong thoracic nerve runs along middle scalene muscle and injury can cause winged scapula.\n\nThe First Rib - The broadest and flattest of the ribs and is an ‘Atypical Rib’ because it only one articular facet.\n\nThe upper surface of the first rib has the scalene and quadrangular tubercles for attachments of the anterior and middle scalene muscles respectively. There are also three grooves for the Subclavian Vein, artery and the Lower Trunk of the Brachial Plexus.\nThe Inferior Surface is smooth and inferior and medially has an attachment for the suprapleural membrane, Sibson’s fascia AKA scalenus minimus muscle, which is tethered to the C7 vertebrae.\n\n\nCostoclavicular Passage - This is the passage of the subclavian vein largely as it emerges through the tight space created by the clavicle, the subclavius muscle and the costoclavicular ligament and also more posteriorly this can also compress the artery and nerves as the space can also be narrow in relation with the scapula and subscapularis. (Gary G Wind and R. James Valentine 2013)\n\nSubclavius Muscle - Attached to the costochondral junction of the first rib and is inserted into the subclavian groove on the inferior surface of the clavicle. (McMinn 2019)\n\nSubcoracoid Space - This space is best appreciated by intimate knowledge of three things(Gary G Wind and R. James Valentine 2013)\n\nThe Coracoid Process\n\nArising from the Scapula as a ‘process’, this broad-based bony landmark offers attachment to muscles and ligaments.\nThe relevant attachments being the pectoralis minor muscle occupying the medial border for about 2cm behind its tip. The tip itself having a medial and lateral facet for the short head of biceps and the coracobrachialis muscles respectively.\n\nPectoralis Minor Muscle:\n\nAttached to the bone of the third, fourth and fifth ribs AND the medial border of the coracoid process.\n\nClavipectoral Fascia:\n\nA sheet of fascial membrane that fills the space between the clavicle and pectoralis minor splitting and encompassing the subclavius muscle. Its superior portion is what can be thickened and become a tight band referred to as the costocoracoid ligament.\n\n\n\nAnomalous Anatomy\n\nPhrenic Nerve Anomaly - The phrenic nerve normally runs anterior to the Subclavian Vein. A rare anomaly is the nerve compressing the vein anteriorly and in very rare circumstances due to the timing of development can run through the vein itself.\nCervical Rib - Anomalous anatomy can also cause TOS especially when patients have a Cervical Rib and anomalous first ribs or a congenital band attaching to the first rib.\n\nIncidence of anomalous first ribs and cervical ribs is 0.76% and 0.75% respectively.\nIncidence of bands are as high as 63% in the general population.

While these are described and mentioned in most texts their utility largely is beyond the scope of a vascular surgeon’s assessment and diagnosis of nTOS.\nAdson Test\n\nExtended abducted and externally rotated arm – palpate radial pulse\nRotate and laterally flex the neck to the ipsilateral side while inhaling deeply.\nA positive test results in reduction or complete obliteration of radial pulse\n\nRoos Test / EAST test\n\nPatient seated and both arms abducted 90 degrees and externally rotated and elbows flexed at 90 degrees.\nOpen and close hands for 3 minutes or until pain or paraesthesia sets in.\n\nElveys Test\n\nAbduct both arms to 90 degrees with elbows extended and dorsiflex both wrists.\nIf pain is elicited as wrists dorsiflexed then test is positive.\nA further maneuver is then performed, laterally flex the head on each side, if pain is elicited on the contralateral side to which the head is flexed then test is positive.

(Rinehardt, Scarborough, and Bennett 2017)\nChyle leak often managed with adequate drainage and medium chain fatty acid diet. Persistent leak should undergo wound exploration and ligation of thoracic duct (most often encountered on the left) or VATS thoracic duct ligation.(Delaney et al. 2017) IR embolization has also been shown to be effective.(Cope, Salem, and Kaiser 1999)"

(Humphries and Freischlag 2019a)\nNow vTOS and Paget Schroetter Syndrome are synonymous.\nPaget Schroetter Syndrome accounts for 10-20% of all upper extremity deep vein thrombosis. (Sekhar 2018)\n\n\n\n4.2.1.1 Presentation\n\nUpper Limb edema, pain and cyanosis. Edema affects the shoulder, arm and hand and characteristically non pitting.\nCollateral vein dilatation over the shoulder, neck and anterior chest wall to accommodate for the increased venous hypertension. (Humphries and Freischlag 2019a)\nPain on exertion of the upper limb described as stabbing, aching or tightness.\nThe reported incidence of PE following upper limb DVT is <12%. (Humphries and Freischlag 2019a)\n\n\n\n\n4.2.2 Evaluation\nUpper extremity venogram is a very useful modality for diagnosis. Compression likely will not be seen in normal orientation, however can be demonstrated with provocative maneuvers including 90 degree arm abduction and external rotation.(Moriarty et al. 2015)\n\nA differential diagnosis for Upper Limb DVT\n\nvTOS\nCongenital Phrenic Nerve anomaly\nHistory of fracture, clavicular fracture and malunion\nRepetitive arm provocative maneuvers, check occupation and history of body-building\n\nPectoralis Minor Hypertrophy.\n\n\nExclude Pulmonary Embolism\nExclude Venous Gangrene and Phlegmasia of the upper limb\n\n\n\n4.2.3 Management\nLimited evidence due to lack of RCT’s. Majority of evidence based on retrospective studies.\n\nPrevent immediate risk\nReturn patient to unrestricted use of the affected extremity\nPrevent recurrence of thrombosis without the need of long-term anticoagulation\nPrevent long term Post Phlebitic Limb Syndrome\n\n\n4.2.3.1 Medical Management\nAs per ACCP Guidelines: Initial management is anticoagulation regardless of etiology. (Kearon et al. 2016)\n\nThe limitations of anticoagulation alone are that the slow recanalization of the thrombus may lead to eventual valvular damage and intravenous scarring. (Sekhar 2018)\n\nCatheter Directed Thrombolysis (CDT) has been considered superior to anticoagulation alone in minimizing valvular damage due to residual clot and carries a lower risk of intracranial hemorrhage.(Urschel and Patel 2008)\n\nSystemic Lysis – non favored due to risk of intracranial hemorrhage. (Grunwald and Hofmann 2004)\nOptimal timing of CDT - Within 14 days of onset of thrombosis. Excellent results have been reported following CDT if initiated before 14 days. (Wilson, Zahn, and Newman 1990)\n\nPatient should be maintained in a compression sleeve until definitive decompression can be performed.\n\n\n4.2.3.2 Surgery\nAfter initial management patients are generally divided into two groups, unsuccessful or successful thrombolysis.\n\nPersistent stenosis or signs of extrinsic compression, on venography, has generally been perceived as a significant risk of recurrent thrombosis.\n\nSurgery for vTOS remains to be mainly Rib Resection and decompression of the subclavian vein with or without venolysis and patch plasty either surgical or endovenous.\n\nSurgical treatment of severe resistant subclavian vein stenosis in the setting of vTOS is rib resection by paraclavicular approach and vein patch plasty. (Melby et al. 2008)\n\nVenous occlusion in vTOS may be treated with jugular turn down or venous bypass to IJ of SVC if patients remain symptomatic. (Vemuri et al. 2016)\n\n\n\n4.2.4 Summary\n\n4.2.4.1 Controversy\nThere is a lack of consensus around the necessity of surgical rib resection, the timing and the requirement for vein patch plasty. Options post recanalization:\n\nDeferring surgical decompression for 1-3 months after thrombolysis to allow for healing of the venous endothelium and resolution of the acute inflammatory process. (Humphries and Freischlag 2019a)\nDecompression during the same admission, as the thrombolysis, with the main benefit being to reduce the risk of re-occlusion. (Humphries and Freischlag 2019a; Molina, Hunter, and Dietz 2007)\nPost decompression venography and treatment 2 weeks post rib resection may help to prevent recurrence and long term vein patency.

(Boll and Valentine 2019) Symptoms are classified according the the Scher staging system.\n\nScher Staging of aTOS(Scher et al. 1984)\n\nStage 0: Asymptomatic\nStage 1: Stenosis of Subclavian Artery with minor post stenotic dilatation with no intimal disruption\nStage 2: Subclavian artery aneurysm with intimal damage and mural thrombus\nStage 3: Distal embolisation from subclavian artery disease\n\n\nSupraclavicular rib resection is the most suitable for adequate arterial reconstruction. Transaxillary has been argued to offer more complete rib resection however arterial repair is not possible in this approach.\nSubclavian artery repair is necessary in Scher Stages 2 and 3 and in some cases 1. Arterial repair with conduit either GSV, Femoral Vein or prosthetic have been described. Ringed PTFE offers good patency and resistance to kinking in this functional anatomical location."

This is attributed to use of dialysis catheters and frequent hospitalizations for arteriovenous access failures and related procedures.\nThe National Kidney Foundation-Dialysis Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF-KDOQI) and SVS has provided guidelines in the follow areas:(Foundation 2015; Sidawy et al. 2008)\n\nTiming of referral to access surgeons\nOperative strategies to maximize placement of autogenous AV accesses\nFirst choice for autogenous access\nChoice of AV access when a patient is not a suitable candidate for a forearm autogenous access\nThe role of monitoring and surveillance of AV access management\nConversion of a prosthetic AV access to a secondary autogenous AV access\nManagement of nonfunctional or failed AV access\n\nThis brings us to the question, who needs dialysis access?\nPatients should be referred to a vascular surgeon for access when their creatinine clearance is <25mL/min which is CKD stage 4. You want to provide adequate time for your autogenous access to mature, so the ideal time for access creation would be > 6 months before anticipated need of dialysis. This allows for time for any subsequent interventions if your access is not maturing.\nShould prosthetic access also be placed several months before anticipated dialysis?\nProsthetic access patency is limited by duration of access placement, thus, if a patient requires prosthetic access, placement should be delayed until about 3-6 weeks before initiation of dialysis.(Foundation 2015)\nFor dialysis access creation, which site should be considered and used first?\nDue to the easier accessibility and lower infection rates, upper extremity access sites are used first. Furthermore, you want to place your access as far distally in the extremity as possible to preserve the proximal arm for future accesses.\nWhat are some important considerations in a patient’s history when planning a dialysis access?\nIt is important to find out recent history of:\n\nPrevious access procedures\nPeripheral IV lines\nSites of any existing or previous indwelling catheters including pacemakers and defibrillators\nTrauma or surgery to the upper extremities\n\nMoreover, you also want to consider the patient’s quality of life, thus, noting which extremity is dominant is important. If possible, you want to create your dialysis access in the non-dominant arm so that when the patient is receiving dialysis multiple times a week, they are able to use their dominant arm during their dialysis sessions.\nHowever, placing a fistula with lowest rate of failure is preferred to using non-dominant hand. Therefore, placement of access on the patients dominant side would be preferred over placement of access with high risk of failure (i.e. on the side of an implantable cardiac device).(Sgroi et al. 2019)\nAs with any preoperative planning, physical examination is extremely important. Central venous stenosis can cause problems such as prolonged bleeding after dialysis sessions at the puncture site. What are some signs of central venous stenosis?\nUnilateral arm swelling or edema and prominent venous collaterals are signs of central venous stenosis. Central venous stenosis can lead to venous hypertension which affects access patency and function, and also causes disabling edema. Placement of AV access in a patient with undiagnosed SVC stenosis or obstruction can cause SVC syndrome.(Kalra, Bjarnason, and Gloviczki 2019)\nBeyond signs of central venous stenosis, when examining a patient, an Allen’s test should always be performed to evaluate palmar arch patency.\nPreoperative planning should also include arterial and venous assessments. What are your size requirements for the artery and the vein to be used in your dialysis access creation?\nFirst, you want equal pressure gradients in bilateral upper extremities. If there is a pressure differential >20mmHg or pulses are non-palpable then patients should undergo a duplex ultrasound to evaluate for arterial insufficiency and and the artery should be greater than or equal to 2mm. Segmental pressures have limited applicability. Patients with correctable lesions on duplex may consider undergoing angiography and intervention to optimize inflow.(Sidawy et al. 2008)\nA venous duplex should also be done to evaluate for diameter, distensibility and continuity. A vein mapping is useful to determine the size of the patient’s superficial veins at various points in the forearm and upper arm. The vein should ideally be at least 3mm, but 2.5mm will likely dilate after regional anesthesia and be sufficient for access particularly in smaller patients.(Huber et al. 2002; Smith, Gohil, and Chetter 2012)\nAutogenous access should always be considered first due to higher patency rates, lower infection rates, and longer duration of access survival. What are the different configurations of autogenous accesses?\nThe first and best option would be direct arteriovenous anastomosis. However, if that is not possible, then venous transposition should be considered next follow by venous translocation.\nVenous transposition is for deeper veins such as the basilic vein, which is transposed so the vein lies just below the skin for easier access for puncture during dialysis sessions. This can be done in either a one-stage or two-stage procedure. In a 2-stage procedure, the direct arteriovenous anastomosis is created during the first stage and once the vein has arterialized 4-6 weeks later, the second stage of transposition is done when the vein is easier to mobilize. Translocation procedures include harvesting the femoral or saphenous vein and using it as a conduit for AV access creation in the upper extremity.\nWhen can a venous transposition be done in a one stage procedure?\nMany surgeons will do a brachiobasilic arteriovenous fistula creation with the transposition in one-stage. However, if the vein is <4mm, it is generally recommended to do a two-stage procedure so that if the fistula fails to mature, the patient does not have to undergo a second operation with extensive dissection of the vein. When a patient has not been initiated on dialysis and there is marginal vein that would require transposition, but carry a significant risk of graft failure then a first-stage BB fistula may be appropriate.\nWhen comparing single- to two-stage brachiobasilic fistula, two-stage creation had high rates of primary patency at 2-years. However, there was no difference in infection rate, steal syndrome, hematoma, pseudoaneurysm, stenosis, failure rate, primary or secondary patency at 1-year or secondary patency at 2-years.(Jun Yan Wee et al. 2018)\nIt was mentioned earlier that the dialysis access should be created as distally as possible on the extremity. What are some of the most distal locations?\nThe snuffbox fistula, which is the posterior radial branch to cephalic direct access and Brescia-Cimino-Appell (often shortened to just Cimino) fistula which is the radial-cephalic wrist direct access are two of the most distal fistulas that can be created. Overall, these have comparable patency and ischemia risk. While snuff box fistulas carry a 10% failure rate at 1mo, the majority are able to be converted to RC fistulas.(Siracuse et al. 2019)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake a Listen\n\n\n\nCheck out our episode on the history of AV Access where we interview Dr. Kenneth Appell, one of the surgeons who pioneered this surgical technique.\n\n\nWhat are your arterial and venous options in the upper extremity?\nIn the forearm, you have your radial, ulnar, and brachial arteries and cephalic and basilic veins. In the upper arm, you have your brachial or proximal radial arteries and cephalic, basilic, brachial and axillary veins.\nIf adequate vein is available, most common access sites distal to proximal include:\n\nSnuff box\nRadiocephalic\nBasilic transposition in forearm\nBrachiocephalic fistula - these have a few advantages over more distal fistulas, including higher maturation rates, decreased time to maturity, higher patency and functional primary patency.(Nguyen et al. 2007)\nBrachiobasilic fistula(Gilmore 2006)\nVein transposition from a remote site - Femoral vein transposition can be used for upper extremity dialysis access in patients with previous upper extremity access complicated by infection, thus not a candidate for prosthetic, but no central stenosis. There is a high rate of hand ischemia due to larger conduit (up to 43%).(Huber et al. 2004)\n\nIf you need to use a prosthetic graft, what would you use?\nPTFE is the most commonly used prosthetic graft. Either a 6mm graft or a tapered 4-7mm graft can be used. The tapered grafts help to ensure that the size of your arterial anastomosis isn’t too large to minimize chances of steal. However, recent publications found that there is no difference between tapered and non-tapered grafts in terms of primary patency, steal syndrome, complication rates or need for reintervention.(Roberts et al. 2019; Han, Seo, and Ryu 2017) Both the 6mm PTFE graft and the tapered 4-7mm PTFE grafts are standard sizes used for dialysis access creation.\nOverall AVG have benefit of earlier cannulation, however they have lower patency rates and higher infection rates. There is no difference between grafts and fistulas for perioperative morbidity and mortality.(Macsata and Sidawy 2019)\nMost prosthetic access will fail because of the development of venous outflow stenosis as a result of smooth muscle proliferation at vein graft interface. Thus, a major cause of graft failure is due to thrombosis. Heparin-bonded PTFE (HB-PTFE) grafts are an option, however, studies have shown no improvement in graft patency with HB-PTFE compared to standard PTFE grafts.(Shemesh et al. 2015; Davies, Anaya-Ayala, and El-Sayed 2016)\nThere are also early cannulation prosthetic grafts, which is another option for patients who need more immediate dialysis access. These grafts are constructed in 3 layers with an elastomeric membrane in the middle between two layers of ePTFE material. This allows for cannulation as early as 24 hours from implantation because the graft configuration minimizes dialysis needle bleeding. This graft options allows for avoidance of a central venous catheter. Studies have shown similar patency rates compared to standard ePTFE, earlier cannulation and catheter removal, and decreased catheter related complications.(Julien Al Shakarchi and Inston 2019; Wagner et al. 2019)\nFor patients with central venous stenosis or occlusion, what is another alternative upper extremity access creation?\nTwo overall strategies for managing patients with severe central venous stenosis or occlusion are lower extremity AV access of hybrid catheter/grafts. Patency of femoral vein transposition is better than hybrid catheter/graft placement.(Brownie 2016; Glickman 2011) We will cover specifics of these techniques later.\nFor lower extremity AV access, femoral vein transposition has been shown to have the best outcomes, followed by saphenous vein transposition and graft placement. Lower extremity access should be avoided in patients with peripheral vascular disease or lower extremity ischemic symptoms–when in doubt perform duplex and segmental pressures to fully evaluate. Veins should also be evaluated to ensure patency more proximally.(Parekh, Niyyar, and Vachharajani 2016)\nFor patients where lower extremity access may not be appropriate, the hemodialysis reliable outflow (HeRO) device can come to the rescue. These devices may not have been encountered in your training, so we will go into detail here. This device is composed of 2 components: a graft which is made of 6mm PTFE with a titanium coupler at one end, and a venous outflow component of a 19 Fr silicone catheter reinforced with a nitinol braid to prevent kinking. The graft portion is anastomosed to an artery, usually brachial, and is tunneled subcutaneously and the venous component is percutaneously placed into the right atrium via the IJ or subclavian vein. The two components are connected with a titanium coupler at the deltopectoral groove. If you need more immediate dialysis, the super HeRO comes to the rescue in which the graft portion is the early cannulation graft.\nFor patients with thoracic central venous occlusion, there is also the SURFACER inside-out access catheter system. This is a device used to cross central occlusions from the right femoral vein. It allows placement of a tunneled central venous catheter, but it can also be utilized as an adjunct for HeRO placement. In a multicenter study, the results from the SAVE (Surfacer System to Facilitate Access in Venous Obstructions) registry showed that in 29 or 30 patients with thoracic central venous occlusion, a central venous catheter was successfully placed. Moreover, there were no device-related adverse events, catheter malposition, or intra- or postprocedural complications. (Gallieni et al. 2020)\nHybrid catheter/grafts are good alternatives in patients with previous line infections, central stenosis, peripheral vascular disease and no suitable vein in the upper extremities. They have shown fewer bacteremia episodes than catheter, low primary patency rate and acceptable secondary patency rates.(J. Al Shakarchi et al. 2015) Absolute contraindications include donor artery <3mm, inability to dilate outflow vein to 19f, allergy to device materials (ePTFE, silicone, titanium, nitinol), and current active infection.(Medical, n.d.)"

    "text": "5.2 Techniques for access creation\nThe techniques of arteriovenous fistula creation are common across access sites. Can you go through the techniques?\nFirst the vein is identified and the distal end is transected and flushed with heparin. By flushing with the heparin, you are able to access the caliber and extent of the vein as well as identify any side branches\nThen after distal and proximal control of your artery, a 4-6mm arteriotomy is made. The length is limited to decrease incidence of arterial steal. The artery is then flushed with heparin to avoid thrombosis during the anastomosis and an anastomosis is created between the side of the artery and the end of the vein. A 6-0 or 7-0 nonabsorbable continuous suture should be used to create the anastomosis to avoid future dilation of the anastomosis.\nFor prosthetic accesses, the length of the arteriotomy does not have to be limited to 4 to 6mm since the incidence of arterial steal is limited by the graft diameter. Both arterial inflow and venous outflow vessels need to be dissected prior to graft anastomoses. The graft should be tunneled close to the surface of the skin to allow for easier cannulation. Meticulous attention to sterile technique is important to avoid graft infections. And as with the fistula creations, a 6-0 or 7-0 nonabsorbable continuous suture should be used to create the anastomosis to avoid future dilation of the anastomosis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake a Listen\n\n\n\nCheck out our episode on the basics of AV Access placement.\n\n\nWhat are some other options if an access is not able to be created in the upper extremity?\nAutogenous accesses can also be created in the lower extremity. Femoral artery to femoral vein or saphenous vein anastomosis can be created. Both veins have to be transposed. Synthetic grafts have high infection rates (as high as 22% in some series) and only a 50% patency at 6 months.(Antoniou et al. 2009; Lazarides et al. 2018; Pike et al. 2019) Risk of lower extremity ischemia increased with burden of PVD, AV fistula vs graft, distal arterial inflow, and large femoral vein mismatch, but can be tempered by banding/narrowing of femoral vein at the time of surgery.(Antoniou et al. 2009; Bourquelot et al. 2012; Gradman, Laub, and Cohen 2005)\nAccess creation in the chest wall or cervical region is also possible with axillary artery to ipsilateral axillary vein loop access, axillary artery to contralateral axillary or jugular vein straight access (ie necklace access) and brachial artery to jugular vein straight access. Keep in mind that for these fistulas, the central veins must be patent.\n\n5.2.1 Anesthetic Considerations\nAre there benefits to different anesthetic techniques used during access placement, such as regional anesthesia?\nRegional anesthesia for AVF creation has been associated with higher perioerative flow and lower rates of vasospasm resulting in higher rates of short term patency. Regional anesthesia has not been associated with perioperative rates of major morbidity or mortality.(Aitken et al. 2016; Siracuse et al. 2014)\nDue to underlying comorbidities, it is often best to avoid general anesthesia in these patients. Many access procedures can be performed under regional or straight local anesthetic. There, it is very important to understand the pharmacokinetics and maximum doses of common local anesthetics.(Neal et al. 2018) Historically, it has been taught that the inclusion of epinephrine allows for higher dosages, but more recent reports do not include this adjustment.(Sztajnkrycer 2019) Common local anesthetics include:\n\nBupivacaine - Long acting. Max SubQ Dose is 2mg/kg.\nLidocaine - Medium acting. Max SubQ Dose is 4.5 mg/kg.\nMepivacaine - Medium acting. Max SubQ Dose is 4.4 mg/kg.\nRopivacaine - Long acting. Max SubQ Dose is 3 mg/kg.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck out this Calculator\n\n\n\nMedCalc has a useful calculator for estimating maximum allowable volume of anesthetic based on patient weight and dose percentage.\n\n\n\n\n5.2.2 Endovascular AV Fistula\nWhat is the role for endovascular creation of AV fistula?\nEndovascular approach to fistula creation without open surgery is another option for dialysis access creation. The results of the NEAT study (Novel Endovacular Access Trial), prospective multicenter study which showed that 98% of the 80 patients enrolled had EndoAVFs created. Of these, 87% were physiologically suited for dialysis, and functional usability (2 needle cannulation) was 64%. Primary patency was 69% and and cumulative patency was 84%. Total complication rate was 8% and this is a promising alternative to surgical arteriovenous fistula creations. (Lok et al. 2017)"

    "section": "5.3 Maintenance and complications",
    "text": "5.3 Maintenance and complications\nWhen is the newly created dialysis access ready for use?\nA good way to remember this is the rule of 6’s. Fistulas should be created about 6 months prior to start of hemodialysis. It is ready to use when the fistula is 6mm in diameter, has a flow of 600ml/min, is 6mm from the surface of the skin and usually takes 6 weeks to mature.\nProsthetic AV accesses can be used as early as 2 weeks postoperatively. If you use the 3-layer early cannulation grafts, the access can be used as early as 24 hours after access creation. This is great because it offers the potential for avoidance of dialysis catheters in patients who need dialysis immediately.(Glickman et al. 2015)\n\n5.3.1 Failure to mature\nWhat are some reasons why an access may fail to mature?\nSometimes your access may have arterial inflow stenosis. This is difficult to detect clinically because there will be a palpable thrill, however, due to the stenosis, the flow is not sufficient enough for dialysis. Dialysis access duplex is a useful way to assess flow volumes and identify areas of stenosis that could be further assessed with fistulogram. In the absence of arterial inflow issues, collateral or large venous branches can divert blood away from the main access channel resulting in insufficient flow. This can be resolved by coiling or ligating the large venous branches that limit maturation of the fistula.\nIf the newly created AV fistula is not maturing, what are some secondary procedures to help with maturation?\nFirst a duplex ultrasound can help to identify whether this is an inflow, outflow, or conduit issue. Once the likely source of the issue is identified, then there are multiple open or endovascular techniques to assist maturation.\nEndovascular procedures include arterial and venous angioplasties to improve inflow or outflow issues.(Sidawy et al. 2008) In particular, balloon assisted maturation (BAM) has been described to decrease maturation time. A prospective randomized controlled study by Elkassaby et al. showed that BAM significantly decreased maturation time and had higher successful functional maturation. However, BAM was also shown to have increased fistula complication rates.(Elkassaby et al. 2021) Open procedures include vein patches, interposition vein grafts, vein transposition to proximal arteries, branch ligations, and vein superficialization.\n\n\n5.3.2 Access Failure\nOnce a dialysis access is created, maintenance of the access is extremely important. The flow disturbances and hemodynamic changes associated with AV access creation causes intimal hyperplasia leading to venous outflow stenosis. This can ultimately lead to access thrombosis and failure. What are some methods of detecting access failure?\nOne way of detecting a well functioning access is a strong thrill at the arterial anastomosis which continues a few centimeters into the outflow vein. If you feel a pulsation near the venous outflow, then a stenosis or thrombosis is likely. If you feel a thrill distal to the area of pulsation, then you have likely localized your area of stenosis. It is important to note that you may feel a pulsation at a pseudoaneurysm independent of venous outflow issues.\nOther signs of outflow stenosis are collateral veins or upper extremity edema.(Padberg, Calligaro, and Sidawy 2008) This is indicative of venous hypertension likely secondary to stenosis. You will typically see this in the shoulder area or anterior chest as a results of subclavian vein stenosis/thrombosis. Moreover, these high venous pressures as a result of the stenosis can result in excessive and prolonged bleeding after removal of needles from the dialysis puncture sites. This is often the first sign of elevated venous pressures. These patients should undergo a fistulogram to evaluate for underlying outflow stenosis.(Caro Monroig et al. 2018) Sometimes, a hematoma from dialysis access cannulation can result in compression of the fistula. In these cases, the hematoma should be drained to relieve the compression.\nThe most common cause of graft failure in upper extremity fistulas is venous outflow stenosis and in grafts is venous anastomotic intimal hyperplasia.(Berman and Gentile 2001; Padberg, Calligaro, and Sidawy 2008) Diagnostic fistulogram is a very useful tool to diagnose and treat potential access complications. Diagnostic fistulogram is often performed with proximal access of the fistula a few centimeters distal to the anastomosis. Compression of venous outflow is necessary to evaluate for inflow and anastomotic issues.(Bountouris et al. 2018)\nFinally, even patients with normal physical exam can have issues while on the hemodialysis circuit, such as recirculation. When in doubt, if there are recurrent issues with hemodialysis, the patient should undergo a fistulogram to evaluate for occult venous outflow stenosis that may be missed on other diagnostic modalities.(Sidawy et al. 2008)\nWhat are some endovascular interventions for a failing access?\nFirst line therapy for outflow stenosis is a simple balloon angioplasty of the stenosed area.(Berman and Gentile 2001) Insufflation times are generally up to 2-3 minutes. Treatment of stenosis 2/2 intimal hyperplasia often require high pressures of 20 ATM or more. However, this is a double edge sword because this can lead to trauma in the veins stimulating a further intimal hyperplasia process. Some advocate a cutting balloon before high pressure dilation. There are also studies showing improved primary patency with drug coated balloons with no difference in survival compared to plain angioplasty.(Han, Seo, and Ryu 2017; Chen et al. 2020; Moreno-Sánchez et al. 2020; Yin et al. 2021) Stenting is also an option to treat residual stenosis or dissections after balloon angioplasty. Covered stents have shown good patency results.\nSome unique situations include, recurrent cephalic arch stenosis which may be best treated with bare metal stenting.(Shemesh et al. 2008) Proximal occlusions (i.e. subclavian) may be best treated primarily with a covered stent.(Agarwal 2015; Anaya-Ayala et al. 2011)\nIf endovascular interventions fail, what are some open options for managing a failing access?\nGenerally an interposition graft or patch angioplasty is performed and the results of the two techniques are largely equivalent.\nIf an AV access has ultimately failed and thrombosed, what are your endovascular options at this point?\nSome endovascular options are catheter directed thrombolysis with about 2-4mg of tPA injected into the clot, followed by balloon angioplasty (typically an 8mm by 8cm high pressure balloon). A mechanical thrombectomy device, such as angiojet, can also be used in combination to thrombolysis.\nAlternatively, an open thrombectomy with a thromboembolectomy balloon and patch angioplasty of venous stenosis areas can also be used. Moreover, a hybrid approach of open thrombectomy with percutaneous interventions of venous stenosis areas has been described. Thrombosed fistulas are difficult to salvage, but thrombosed AV grafts have a high likelihood of successful recannalization and should be managed aggressively.\nImmediate postoperative thrombosis of an AV graft is likely technical - inadequate inflow (i.e. small brachial artery) or outflow stenosis/occlusion. Open revision and thrombectomy is often the best option.(Paulson, Ram, and Zibari 2002)\nWhat are some ways to manage failing AV access in the setting of ipsilateral vTOS?\nPerforming a first rib resection in a hemodialysis patient is high risk and controversial. However, if there is a prominent external jugular vein, then there are reports of external to internal jugular vein transposition offering more in line drainage and access salvage.(DeGiovanni, Son, and Salehi 2020)\n\n\n5.3.3 Steal Syndrome\nEarlier, you mentioned steal syndrome, can you explain to us what this is?\nSteal syndrome is also known as Access Related Hand Ischemia (ARHI). It is an uncommon but devastating complication of access creation. All patients with arteriovenous fistulas have some degree of physiologic steal or reversal of flow in part of the artery distal to the fistula. However, this is not sufficient enough to cause ischemia. Rather, ischemia results from inadequate collateral circulation and inability of peripheral arteries to meet the increased demand. Diseased vessels do not dilate and stenosis of arteries leads to decreased distal perfusion pressure. Furthermore, hypotension during dialysis further decreases perfusion causing symptoms. Steal can be limb threatening and is graded as follows:\n\nGrade 0 - asymptomatic, no flow augmentation or steal\nGrade 1 - asymptomatic, mild ischemia with signs of cool extremity and flow augmentation with access occlusion (May be seen in over half of AV access patients)(Leake et al. 2015)\nGrade 2 - moderate/intermittent ischemia that is experienced only during dialysis and patients feel effort induced ischemic pain.\nGrade 3 - severe, ischemic pain at rest with tissue loss.\n\nWhat are some symptoms and signs of Steal syndrome?\nSymptoms include coolness, parasthesias, rest pain, and weakness. Signs of steal include cool to touch, pallor, cyanosis, delayed capillary refill, absent pulses/signals, diminished sensation, weak grip, and in severe cases ulceration or gangrene. If the patient shows improvement with access compression, diagnosis is confirmed.\nPatients with acute pain and loss of pulses immediately after AVF creation should first have arterial injury/thrombosis ruled out, but then after diagnosed with steal syndrome should undergo fistula ligation.(Schanzer and Eisenberg 2004; Yevzlin, Chan, and Asif 2016)\nWhen is an intervention necessary to treat steal syndrome?\nYou do not need to intervene for grade 0 and 1.(Leake et al. 2015) For grade 3 an intervention is mandatory. The goal of treatment includes symptom resolution and access preservation, and this is achieved by reducing access flow and increasing distal arterial flow.\nThe most important finding on duplex ultrasound to evaluate for steal syndrome is fistula flow rate. High flow rates suggest a primary problem with the fistula, low or normal flow suggests underlying PVD and inflow insufficiency as etiology.(Julien Al Shakarchi et al. 2016; Leake et al. 2015) Approximately 5% of steal is secondary to inflow stenosis.\nWhat are your intervention options for resolving steal syndrome?\nThere are multiple ways to manage steal syndrome, detailed as follows:(Leake et al. 2015; Gupta et al. 2011)\n\nAV Fistula Banding is a simple option to reduce access flow. This is done by suture plication, placement of single narrowing tie or wrap by constrictive cuff to cause a stenosis in the AV access near the arterial anastomosis.\n\nA minimally invasive approach is used by the MILLER banding which uses an endoluminal 4 or 5mm balloon as a sizer and a suture is placed around the access with the balloon inflated.\nThis procedure increases arterial inflow towards the hand. One technique describes using intra-operative finger pressures and plication to result in intraoperative increase in finger pressure by 20% or a minimum of 90mmHg. Flow should be maintained at 600ml/min.\n\nRevision using distal inflow (RUDI) involves ligation of the fistula at the arterial anastomosis and reestablishment of flow via a more distal artery by bypass or vein translocation. This allows for decreased flow through the access by reducing the fistula diameter and by taking inflow form a smaller vessel. However, ultimately, the fistula is placed at risk.\nProximalizaiton of arterial inflow (PAI) involves ligation of AV anastomosis, and the inflow is moved to a more proximal level with a prosthetic interposition. Dialysis can be continue via the vein. The main advantage is the native artery’s continuity.(Zanow, Kruger, and Scholz 2006)\nDistal revascularization-interval ligation (DRIL) is ultimately considered the best option by many vascular surgeons due to the excellent results shown. There is an arterial bypass created originating proximal to the access and ending distal to the access, with ligation of the artery distal to the anastomosis. This prevents retrograde flow from distal vessels and allows for a low resistance pathway for arterial supply to the hand. DRIL may be particularly useful in patients with distal brachial, proximal ulnar/radial disease, as this can bypass the underlying stenosis as well.(Leake et al. 2015)\nDistal radial artery ligation (DRAL) can be performed for palmar arch steal syndrome from radio-cephalic av accesses, to prevent reversal of flow in the palmar arch. However, the ulnar artery patency needs to evaluated first.\n\n\n\n5.3.4 Neuropathy and Neuropraxia\nWhat complication often presents like steal syndrome, but with easily palpable distal pulses?\nAccess creation can result in neuropathy. It is important to note that over 2/3s of the patients have preexisting peripheral neuropathy. Neuropathy is also graded:\n\nGrade 0 - asymptomatic\nGrade 1 - mild intermittent changes (pain, paresthesia, numbness with sensory deficit)\nGrade 2 - moderate persistent sensory changes\nGrade 3 - severe sensory changes with progressive motor loss (motion, strength, muscle wasting).\n\nIschemic Monomelic Neuropathy (IMN) is rare but occurs acutely after AV access creation. Within hours of surgery, patients develop acute pain, weakness, or paralysis of hand and forearm muscles with prominent sensory loss. However, the hand is warm with palpable pulse or audible signal in distal radial and ulnar arteries. It is important to note that pain out of proportion is what differentiates IMN from ARHI. Treatment is access ligation or emergent augmentation of flow.\n\n\n5.3.5 Perioperative neuropraxia\nWhat are some common technical complications after placement of AV access?\nPost operative numbness of the thumb, index and middle finger and weakness of abduction and grip strength may suggest median nerve neuropraxia and will likely resolve. However, you need to rule out steal syndrome.(Talebi et al. 2011; Vahdatpour et al. 2012)\nPostoperative hematoma can often just be observed. However, signs of median nerve compression mandate immediate operative brachial sheath evacuation or the neurologic deficits may become permanent.(Padberg, Calligaro, and Sidawy 2008)\nProsthetic grafts can results in seroma from ultrafiltration of the graft and most resolve without intervention.\n\n\n5.3.6 Bleeding and Aneurysm\nWhat presentations require urgent revision?\nFistulas that present with bleeding from a visible ulcer, wet scabbing, frank infection or acute pseudoaneurysm often require urgent open revision. Some access may be salvaged, but in acute presentations with significant risk of life threatening hemorrhage the safest option may be to ligate the access and place a temporary dialysis access line.(Galbusera, Remuzzi, and Boccardo 2009)\nMany fistulas develop aneurysms over time. When do fistula aneurysms require revision?\n\nPseudoaneurysms often result from trauma due to repeated punctures or poor technique\nTrue aneurysms result from long standing hemodynamically significant outflow stenosis.(Hossny 2014; Patel et al. 2015)\n\nBoth can lead to cannulation difficulties, increased risk of thrombosis, pain, bleeding and cosmetic deformities. AV aneurysms should be revised if they develop skin thinning, ulceration or bleeding. Early skin changes can be observed. Intervention often requires revision with open plication/excision or ligation. When isolated to a short segment, attempts should be made to salvage the fistula.(Al-Jaishi et al. 2017; Al-Thani et al. 2017; Pasklinsky et al. 2011)"

    "text": "5.4 Dialysis Catheters\nWhile ideally every patient would have surgically placed access, many patients still receive dialysis through catheters. What is the difference between an acute and chronic hemodialysis catheter?\nChronic catheters have a subcutaneous cuff at the exit site and tunneled to the vein. This decreases infection rates and makes them less likely to become dislodged. Tunneled hemodialysis catheters can be used up to 12 months.\nIf catheters cause so much problems such as infection and central venous stenosis, what would be an indication for them?\nThe most common indication would be for urgent hemodialysis. But other indications include patient who are not operative candidates due to advanced comorbidities, or patients who are unable to have an AVF or AVG due to anatomic feasibility. Temporary dialysis access may also be needed in patients who have just had a peritoneal dialysis catheter placement or in chronic peritoneal dialysis catheter patients requiring abdominal or inguinal surgery.\nWhich site is the most ideal site for a hemodialysis catheter?\nThe right internal jugular vein with a tip in at the cavo-atrial junction is preferred because it has the best patency. Subclavian veins are avoided due to high risk of stenosis and femoral veins are avoided due to infection risk.\nIf all traditional access sites are inaccessible, translumbar IVC catheters may be used as a last resort as salvage. Overall complications are similar to other permanent dialysis access sites, however obesity is a relative contraindication due to potential migration into the soft tissues.\nEvery procedure has potential complications. What are the immediate complications of catheter placement?\nWhen placed in the internal jugular veins, there is always a chance of a pneumothorax or hemothorax. Wire embolism can occur is control of the wire is lost during the procedure. If the guidewire is placed too far, then there is always a chance of arrhythmia. Thus, the best place for the wire is through the IVC. With a left internal jugular vein approach, there is always a risk of thoracic duct laceration. If a leak is apparent, then the catheter needs to be removed immediately and a pressure dressing applied.\nHow do you manage infected hemodialysis lines?\nInfected hemodialysis lines should be removed. Ideally you should avoid replacing any lines until blood cultures have been negative for 48hrs, particularly subsequent permanent lines(Group 2006)"

    "text": "5.5 Peritoneal Dialysis\nAlthough not often managed by the vascular surgeon, we should still be aware of another method of dialysis in renal failure patients. What are the indications for peritoneal dialysis?\nPeritoneal dialysis is better tolerated and less disruptive to daily life, so is often a better option for young, active patients with less comorbidities. PD can be considered first-line or in patients who are not candidates for HD, but require high patient engagement and education and so may not be appropriate for patients with other chronic diseases limiting independence, unstable housing, cognitive decline or poor management other medical issues.(Ansari 2011)\nFrom a technical standpoint, PD may be difficult in patients who have had multiple previous open abdominal surgeries, but can be tolerated in patients who have had minimally invasive or minor abdominal procedures.(Sinnakirouchenan and Holley 2011) Long dwell times with glucose solution can sometimes lead to hyperglycemia. The major reason for conversion from PD to HD is PD catheter infection.(Li et al. 2017)\n\n\n\n\nAgarwal, Anil K. 2015. “Endovascular Interventions for Central Vein Stenosis.” Kidney Research and Clinical Practice 34 (4): 228–32. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.krcp.2015.10.005.\n\n\nAitken, Emma, Andrew Jackson, Rachel Kearns, Mark Steven, John Kinsella, Marc Clancy, and Alan Macfarlane. 2016. “Effect of Regional Versus Local Anaesthesia on Outcome After Arteriovenous Fistula Creation: A Randomised Controlled Trial.” Lancet (London, England) 388 (10049): 1067–74. https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(16)30948-5.\n\n\nAl Shakarchi, J., J.

    "text": "6.1 Demographics\nWhat is an aortic dissection?\nIt’s when a tear occurs in the intima that results in separation of layers of the intima and media and allows blood to flow through the false lumen.\nHow common are they and how serious are they?\nAcute dissections occur around 3/100000 - 2-3x more common than ruptured aortic aneurysm. For Type A dissections, early mortality 1-2% per hour - if untreated, 20% die within 6 hours, 50% within 24 hours, 70% first week.\nMain cause of death in type A is aortic rupture into the pericardium, acute aortic regurgitation, and coronary ostia compromise. While patients with descending thoracic aortic dissections are more likely to die from end organ compromise due to obstruction of visceral or extremity vessels in the acute phase of the disease.\nThe time frame is also important.\n\nHyperacute <24 hours\nAcute < 2 weeks\nSubacute 2 weeks – 3 months -> TEVAR\nChronic >3 months -> Chronic aneurysmal degeneration/ partial false lumen thrombosis (highest risk) = operative treatment\n\n\n6.1.1 Classification and Terminology\nWhen we think about aortic dissections there are a few classifications, how can we break it down?\nHistorically, there are the Stanford and Debakey Criteria.\nAnatomical Stanford\n\nType A - involves the ascending aorta, 2/3 (most common)\nType B - arises from distal to L subclavian, 1/3\n\nDebakey\n\nA\n\n1 - ascending + descending\n2 - ascending only\n\nB - distal or at the LSCA.\n\n3a - Descending aorta above diaphragm\n3b - Descending aorta above and below diaphragm\n\n\nHow about the new system proposed by Dr Lombardi, the SVS-STS classification system?\nThe new system published in 2020 keeps A and B and adds a number system which divides the aorta into zones from 0 proximally to 12 distally in the mid SFA. (Lombardi, Hughes, et al. 2020)\n\n\n\n\n\nType A is now JUST the ascending aorta to the innominate, also called Zone 0.\nType B is now an entry tear in Zone 1 or greater and distally to whichever zone the dissection lands in.\n\n6.1.1.1 Penetrating Aortic Ulcer and Intramural Hematoma\nThis anatomical classification is based on reading the CT angio. What else could we see on a CT angio that we have to know about?\nSo aside from the aortic dissection its self, you could see a bleb of contrast sticking out. That could be an penetrating aortic ulcer. That is an atherosclerotic plaque that penetrates the internal elastic lamina of the aortic wall.(Ciccone et al. 2016)\nAnother key finding can be an intramural hematoma which is a hyper-dense crescent shaped hemorrhage within the aortic wall. There is no identifiable direct communication between the true and false lumen. IMH are classified in the same way but with the abbreviation IMH p-d zones.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhats the significance of these two in combination?\nThere is a higher chance of aortic rupture if a penetrating aortic ulcer is seen with intramural hematoma.\nWhen a patient presents with an aortic dissection how can we classify them clinically?\n\nUncomplicated\n\nStable hemodynamics\nNo evidence of malperfusion\nPain controlled\n\nComplicated\n\nEnd organ ischemia / malperfusion\nRupture or impending rupture\n\nHigh risk for early complication or continued growth(Bogerijen et al. 2014; Reutersberg et al. 2018)\n\nUncontrollable pain / hypertension\nBloody pleural effusion\nAortic diameter >40mm / False lumen diameter > 22mm\nReadmission\nRadiographic only malperfusion\nEntry tear on the lesser curve\nNumber vessels originating from false lumen and length of dissection.(Brunkwall et al. 2014; Kamman et al. 2017; Nienaber et al. 2009)\n\n\nWhat is the danger of a false lumen? How does it lead to symptoms and malperfusion? Likewise which arteries commonly branch off the true lumen?\nThe false lumen can lead to end organ ischemia as the intimal flap can cover the ostia of branching vessels. This can be a static or a dynamic obstruction.\nLikewise it also leads to weakening in the wall of the aorta which can become a threatened rupture or rupture if the diameter of the false lumen is larger than 22mm.\nThe celiac trunk, SMA, right renal typically come of the true lumen. Left renal comes off the false.\nAlso the dissection most commonly goes down into the left common iliac rather than the right. You might be able to detect down stream effects of this on clinical exam with reduced left sided groin pulse.\nThe presence of multiple false lumens is associated with increased risk of aortic dissection related death.(Sueyoshi et al. 2013)\nWhat kind of patients get aortic dissections?\nHypertension (older patients) vs cocaine or Meth (younger patients)\nMarfans, Loeys-Dietz, Vascular Ehlers Danlos (Type 4), Turners, arteritis, Bicuspid aortic valve.\nWe also have a traumatic cause of aortic dissections. That being called blunt thoracic aortic injury:\n\nGrade 1: intima tear\nGrade 2: IMH\nGrade 3: Pseudo aneurysm\nGrade 4: Aortic rupture.\n\nFor more on the management of blunt aortic trauma, see Chapter 9\n\n\n\n6.1.2 Presentation\nHow do these patients present?\nSigns and symptoms – Chest pain 90% tearing pain radiating between the shoulder blades.\nChest pain extending to the abdomen abdomen? Think mesenteric ischemia or aortic tear\nType A - Stroke 5-10%, Syncope 15%, tamponade, carotid dissection, paralysis.\nOthers: MI, Hypovolemic shock, leg ischemia"

    "text": "6.3 Management\nWhat are the details of Type A treatment?\nOperative treatment with a 30% operative mortality. Let cardiothoracic take the lead on this one. However vascular surgeons should be involved in the management of type A as after the repair, a type A can become a functional type B.\nType B is in the realm of vascular surgery. What is the first management step after we have diagnosed a type B dissection?\nInvasive impulse therapy aimed to reduce aortic wall stress.(Hughes, Andersen, and McCann 2013; Nienaber and Clough 2015) That means reducing the force of transmitted impulse down the aorta with blood pressure goals of 100-120mmHg and Hr < 60bpm.\nHow would you achieve that?\nStart with a beta-blocker (esmolol or labetalol) first then a vasodilator (nitroprusside). This is to stop the sympathetic surge after vasodilation that could increase pressure and thus tearing forces inside the aorta worsening the dissection.\nInitial CT, 72 hours, 3 months x 4, q6 months x2, q12 month. (Descending thoracic aorta that dilates first.)\nWhy isn’t open surgery indicated for type B dissections?\nOpen surgery is not recommended due to the high mortality 30% if < 48 hours. 18% if > 49 hours.(Trimarchi et al. 2006)\nIn the acute setting mortality can be up to 50% with a 20% paraplegia risk. Its been described as sowing tissue paper.\nWhat is the management plan for a complicated Type B aortic dissection?\nStart with invasive medical management and plan for TEVAR. The goal with TEVAR being to direct the blood flow into the true lumen and seal the entry tear. If there was a dynamic obstruction (flap occludes branching vessels.) Then TEVAR would reestablish the true lumen hence removing the dynamic obstruction. Endovascular fenestration can also equalize the pressure in the true and false lumen. (Lombardi, Gleason, et al. 2020)\nFor a static occlusion there could be a thrombus or stenosis in the branched vessel so a stent might be indicated.\nWhat are the major risks of TEVAR in the management of Type B aortic dissections?\n\nRetrograde type A (reported 2% in literature however it can be around 20% in some experiences). Carries a high mortality (ranging from 7-50%). Factors associated with retrograde dissection include:\n\nOver-sized endograft - every 1% over 9% results in an increase in retrograde dissection of 14%.(Canaud et al. 2014)\nProximal landing zone more than 40mm (2% -> 18%)\nPeriprocedural hypertension\nUnderlying aortopathy.(Tjaden et al. 2018)\n\nParaplegia (reported around 5%)\nStent induced new entry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake a Listen\n\n\n\nCheck out Dr Arko’s conversation on the BackTable podcast to learn more about the complications of TEVAR management in dissections.\n\n\nIs there a role for TEVAR in uncomplicated type B dissections?\nThe INSTEAD and INSTEAD XL trials looked at uncomplicated Type B dissections. There was NO statistical difference at 2 years comparing OMT vs TEVAR but at 5 years there was good aortic remodeling and better long term survival in patients treated in the sub-acute stage.\nTiming for TEVAR is a difficult choice. In chronic dissections the septum thickens leading to a potentially difficult TEVAR. Anecdotally, TEVAR is best at 2 weeks to 3 months.\nIt should be noted, that both the thoracic and abdominal aorta often continue to dilate even after repair so follow up surveillance is paramount.(Famularo, Meyermann, and Lombardi 2017)\nIf repair must extend into Zone 2, then pre-TEVAR carotid subclavian bypass should seriously be considered in elective/urgent inpatient setting to reduce the risk of periprocedural stroke (1.9% vs 14.3%).(Bradshaw et al. 2017; Teixeira et al. 2017) Revascularization of the L subclavian with a L subclavian bypass is particularly important with a LIMA CAMB or a dominant L vertebral and a transposition is not appropriate.(Morasch 2009; Matsumura et al. 2009)\n\n\n\n\nBogerijen, Guido H.

    "text": "Authors: Rachael Forsythe, Mohamed Barkat, Nicholas Greaves, and Michael Jenkins\nContributors: Sharif Ellozy and Leanna Erete\nTreatment for thoracoabdominal aneurysms has become a bit of sub-specialization within vascular surgery, with the best outcomes achieved at high-volume centers with close partnerships with cardiothoracic surgery.(Cowan et al. 2003) While the majority of vascular surgeons may not manage these patients in their day to day practice, and many trainees have limited exposure, this topic is still fair game for examinations and should be reviewed. However, endovascular techniques are still evolving and practice varies widely between centers and so covering this topic may not be particularly high yield.\nThis chapter was developed by surgeons in the United Kingdom, where manufactured custom devices have broader regulatory approval and are more widely available. The availability of these devices in the United States is more limited and so management decisions are different depending on what devices are available. However, the basic principles of open management and overall clinical decision making are shared no matter what side of the Atlantic ocean you practice."

    "text": "7.1 Demographics\n\n7.1.1 Anatomy\nCan you take us through the Crawford classification to start off?\nThe Crawford classification is relatively recent (1986) and is a very practical classification, depending on body cavity and how to get to an aneurysm.(Crawford et al. 1986) This classification doesn’t follow an expected pattern as getting either more extensive or less extensive.\n\nType I - These extend from the left subclavian down to just below the diaphragm, which distinguishes it from an isolated thoracic aneurysm, which you can get to just from the chest. Going into a second body cavity is a very important differentiating marker.\nType II - These are the biggies, they extend from the left subclavian all the way down to your bifurcation. So both abdominal and thoracic exposure, all the visceral, renal arteries and a lot of intercostal and lumbers–so big impact for cord supply, et cetera.\nType III - These extend from the mid chest down to and involving the viscera, renals, and bifurcation. These differentiate from Type 2 because you may not need to utilize full support and may risk a clamp and go approach.\nType IV - These are characterized by being accessible from the abdomen, in most patients, although it often does require division of the crus. In most patients, because there are some anatomical situations with body habitus, which means that going into the left chest is useful even for type four aneurysm.\nType V - This was an additional classification that was added by Dr. Hazim Safi’s group later, which is a bit like a type III at the top of the type I at the bottom effectively.(Safi and Miller 1999)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake a Listen\n\n\n\nCheck out our conversation with Dr. Hazim Safi where he discusses the history of TAAA repair and much, much more.\n\n\nThere appears to have been an increase in the incidence of thoracoabdominal aneurysms. Do you think it’s a true increase or does this relate to having scans for other reasons picked up by accident and then going on from that? What sort of many referrals do you get in a year and what’s your turn down?\nThe overall incidence of infrarenal atherosclerotic abdominal aneurysms is going down every year in the national UK vascular registry, likely related to smoking reduction for a big group of patients. I think thoracoabdominal aneurysms are going up partly because we are now imaging more and more people and therefore we are imaging the chest and seeing them.\nSo that’s an artificial increase in incidence, but also the rate of aortic dissection is on the rise and chronic post dissection aneurysms are increasing. In addition, I think it’s a small group, but there is more knowledge about connective tissue disease, genetic studies and family screening, which perhaps is also a small part of annual increase. So over the next 10-20 years, aneurysms are not going to go away, and there is a huge number now within the national UK screening program under surveillance for small aneurysms.\n\n\n7.1.2 Etiology\nAre there major differences in presentation and etiology between thoracoabdominal aneurysms and abdominal aortic aneurysms from your experience?\nOn presentation, the majority of aneurysms are asymptomatic so they are most often found incidentally. Rarely, they get symptomatic and can get tender as they approach a time when the wall is going to breach pre-rupture. I think thoracoabdominal aneurysms tend to be a bit more symptomatic than infrarenal but may have some atypical symptomatic presentations.\n\nSome that extend into the arch may present with hoarseness from recurrent laryngeal tension or bronchial compression.\nThere is a group that cause dilatation of the crus. The crus of the diaphragm acts like an extrinsic wrap and can be extremely tight. These patients present with excruciating pain, radiating around their costal margin, which is a presentation not often thought of as a sign of an aneurysm.\nThe larger extent and more chronic aneurysms may even present with things like weight loss and general poor health.\n\nThe other group that is a little different than infrarenal aneurysms, is the post dissection aneurysms. The majority of these are known and followed closely, however there was a time when patients with a type A dissections that extended all the way down were only followed with with echo of the ascending and the rest was forgotten about. Many of them got lost from cardiothoracic follow up. That group is a different group because we already know they’ve got an aneurysm. So there are subtle differences.\nAnd then the connective tissue group, I suppose, is a bit different because they tend to have more extensive aneurysms rather than just confined to the infrarenal segment, which is by far and way, the most common for abdominal aneurysms.\nDo you think patients with thoracic aneurysms as a result of dissection or connective tissue disease have a different threshold for intervention compared to the non-connective tissue disorder patients?\nI think we need to be aware that the connective tissue disorders we talk about—Marfans, Loeys Dietz, vascular Ehlers Danlos—are probably the tip of the iceberg. There are likely a number of other cases that we don’t have genetic sequencing for, but behave differently than classic atherosclerotic aneurysms. The data from a dimension point of view is not quite as robust as one would hope, but the threshold that most people would agree for non connective tissue disorders would be about six centimeters. That takes into account the increased risks of operating both in the chest and the abdominal segment.\nI think most people would agree that five centimeters is a better cutoff for connective tissue patients. Some cardiac surgeons would repair a young Marfan ascending aneurysm at four and a half centimeters. It does vary a little bit geographically, a bit like the threshold for infrarenal aneurysms, which varies between Europe, the States and the UK. So you’ve got to look at the patient in front of you and make a decision. I would certainly increase the threshold for someone who was not so fit and perhaps lower it a bit for a younger patient.\nFor more about connective tissue related aortopathies, see Chapter 8\nAlso, be aware if it’s something odd anatomically—a saccular bulge, an eccentric penetrating aortic ulcer (PAU), or something where you think there could be a mycotic element—those are all very different. You can’t be reassured by a dimension in an axial plane that is safe. These findings up the ante, in terms of whether you would repair at an earlier threshold because they do not behave like a conventional fusiform aneurysm.\nCan you talk us through the Ishimaru zones of the aorta?\nIshimaru is a useful classifications. There are a lot classifications in medicine, but it’s nice to find one that’s actually useful. This classification made sure that everyone was on the same page when reporting proximal seals zones for thoracic devices. That is important for two reasons:\n\nThe extent of coverage\nThe complications increased, the more proximally you go. The main complication for that is stroke.\n\nSo historically, Ishimaru decided to classify these zones as(Ishimaru 2004):\n\nZone 0, the first most proximal zone, is the ascending aorta up to and including the brachiocephalic trunk\nZone 1 is between the brachiocephalic trunk and including the left common carotid artery\nZone 2 is between the left common carotid artery and including the left subclavian artery\nZone 3 is the aortic segment just distal to the left subclavian artery.\nZone 4, added by some people, is distal to the T4 level, which is much lower down the thoracic aorta\n\nMost thoracic stenting will go really to zone three or perhaps into zone two. The more proximal you go, the more work needs to be done in terms of either extra anatomical debranching or using some form of fenestrated or branched arch device with an increase in stroke risk. What this allowed people to do is compare different series. You’re not just saying these were a group of TEVAR patients, but you could define exactly how proximally they go.\nAnd the same applies for the Crawford classification. It allows comparison within thoracoabdominal groups, and that’s important with both survival and complication rates. Because if your series is mainly type II thoracoabdominal aneurysms, you’re going to have a very different outcomes from someone who’s got mainly type IV aneurysms. Both classifications allow you to look at and compare data between groups.\nFor a discussion of the new SVS/STS classification system for aortic dissections, please see Chapter 6"

    "text": "7.2 Management\n\n7.2.1 Ascending aorta and arch\nThe cardiac surgeons use many different techniques for managing an ascending aortic aneurysm or dissections, which is beyond the scope of this review. However, in preparation for management of aneurysms or dissections that extend beyond the arch, they often utilize an elephant trunk down the descending aorta. Can you briefly summarize the difference between a conventional elephant trunk and a frozen elephant trunk, and when to use one over the other?\nThis is particularly pertinent to aortic dissection. The the main purpose of repair in Type A dissection is to protect the heart. People die of either rupture into pericardium causing tamponade or stripping the coronary ostia off and getting myocardial ischemia. So the priority of repair in acute ascending aortic dissection is primarily to protect the heart and to some extent to ensure a true lumen flow distally. Therefore, it was very popular because it was the least invasive to do a short interposition ascending repair, but that left problems for later.\nAs people became more adept with cardiac and cerebral protection, it became more popular to do a more extensive repair in the first sitting. This involves an arch repair and an acceptance that eventually the descending thoracic aorta will still need to be repaired, but at a later stage. The ascending and arch is done from a median sternotomy, and it’s really difficult to get beyond the left subclavian from that position.\nSo when the arch was done, the elephant trunk came from leaving an extra piece of Dacron within the descending thoracic aorta in the true lumen of a dissection or in the main lumen of an aneurysm by a double sewing technique on the distal anastomosis and then inverting it down the descending thoracic aorta. The benefit of that was when returning to repair descending thoracic segment via left thoracotomy, you couldquickly open the aorta and clamp that Dacron for a ready, made proximal anastomosis. This was much easier, because it meant you didn’t have to dissect all the way up to the left subclavian with scar tissue and a previous anastomosis.\nNow, what industry realized is that they could help with this procedure by developing a Dacron device sized to be an arch replacement which had three or four ready-sewn 10 millimeter branches with an extra pipe for rewarming. These branches are used as bypasses to the innominate, carotid and subclavian and attached to that piece of Dacron was a stent graft, which could be placed distally in lieu of what was previously a floppy piece of Dacron.\nAnd two manufacturers, JOTEC and Terumo Aortic, have made these devices, which facilitate and make things much easier. Therefore, so-called FET or frozen elephant trunk, has now become quite popular. I don’t quite know why it’s called frozen, but I think it perhaps means that the thoracic segment is stiff with a supported stent graft rather than just a floppy Dacron segment.\n\n\n7.2.2 Isolated Thoracic Aneurysms\nFor isolated thoracic aneurysm treated with TEVAR, what is the optimal landing zone?\nSo I think the isolated, thoracic aneurysm is a perfect application for TEVAR because if you can get a good seal zone, proximally and distally, it provides an an endoluminal approach and saves a thoracotomy, which is a massive difference for these patients. Unfortunately I suppose those cartoons you see on the industry advertisements are vanishingly rare, when you’ve got a perfect proximal and distal landing zone and a really straight thoracic aorta.\nI think for the majority of cases, you need a 2cm seal zone proximally and distally. However, if you have a torturous aorta, you likely need a longer seal zone. You want to land in an area where there is a good parallel walled walled segment. You have to be careful of so-called “bird-beaking” when a stiff, less conformable device lands perfectly on the outer curve, but holds off on the inner curve. This results in a lip, which protrudes and allows blood to get under that and cause stent graft crushing.(Marrocco-Trischitta et al. 2019)\nModern day outcomes are very good, because I think modern devices have become much more conformable. We’ve learned many lessons to avoid too much oversizing and how to taper stent grafts when there’s mismatch between proximal and distal landing zones.\nThese have all significantly improved things, but there’s still no getting away from the fact that some anatomy is not well adjusted to the currently available stent grafts. Gothic arches, torturous and large sacks, are a problem and can allow a stent graft to move away from the center line to the outer curve.(Iwakoshi et al. 2019) If that sac doesn’t shrink, you can imagine that draws on both the proximal and distal seals zone, and reduces them.\nI think you can sometimes get away with a shorter landing zone. If, for example, you’re doing a post traumatic aneurysm where it’s only on one segment of the outer wall where there’s a problem. But for the vast majority of true aneurysms, you need that seal zone and you do need to oversize to achieve that.\nFor more on the endovascular management of traumatic aneurysms, see Chapter 9\nDo you utilize rapid ventricular pacing when deploying these stents?\nI think the majority of aneurysms at the left subclavian area, you can just drop the blood pressure to a systolic of 70 or 80 pharmacologically. Once you go more proximal to that, especially if you’ve got a custom device, with a scallop or branched device where you need an absolutely critical landing zone, you then really need to achieve a short transient period of circulatory arrest, either with adenosine, which is perhaps sometimes a bit unreliable, or rapid pacing.\nRapid Pacing can be difficult and does come with complications though, such as ventricular puncture. There are some newer techniques in terms of caval occlusion balloons, which basically stop venous blood returning to the heart with a reduction in output. Those are gaining popularity certainly in Germany and they can be quite effective for that. I think having tip capture on devices and better, more accurate deployment and better imaging does allow you to be more accurate in deployment, but there are still problems.\nThese devices have been inserted to very torturous iliac systems sometimes and they retain some energy. When you deliver them by removing that sheath, sometimes that energy is still there and they can jump forward as well as back. This can cause problems because you end up covering a vessel that you didn’t intend to.\nAs we have described TEVAR is a great option for the majority of isolated, thoracic aneurysms, but is there still a place for open repair?\nI’m not so sure in isolated, thoracic aneurysms, unless for some reason they’re not suitable for TEVAR. I think if you’ve got problems with a mycotic aneurysm or a fistula into the bronchus or esophagus, these are our big problems with high mortality and your duty bound to go for open repair.\nPatients with hemoptysis and a previous aortic repair should carry a high suspicion for an aortobronchial fistula. TEVAR is considered preferred repair, due to high morbidity and mortality with open repair. Bronchoscopy should be avoided due to high risk of rebleeding.(Bailey et al. 2011; Léobon et al. 2002; Quintana et al. 2006)\nCertainly with connective tissue patients, open has advantages. In some unique situations it is possible to bridge between repairs. I think in some of the younger connective tissue patients, they will end up having certain segments repaired at different stages of their life. Although it’s probably now accepted that “all endovascular” is not a good option for these patients, if you’ve got Dacron proximally and distally already, bridging those segments with an endovascular device might work well. Although the Dacron will slowly dilate, it won’t dilate as much as aortic tissue in these patients. So there are options, but I think in reality, isolated, thoracic aneurysms on reasonable rare and TEVAR can be used for the majority of them.\n\n\n7.2.3 Thoracoabdominal Aneurysms\nMoving on to thoracoabdominal aneurysms. Earlier we used the Crawford classification to describe the anatomical extent of the thoracoabdominal aneurysm. So let’s talk firstly, about type 1, 2, 3, and 5, which involved the thoracic of water to a greater or lesser extent as well as the abdominal aorta. We’ll come back to type IV later on in this podcast.\nSo type II open thoracoabdominal aneurysm is arguably the most invasive operation a patient can undergo and carries 30 day mortality in excess of 10 to 15%. What is the size threshold for type II that you currently use in your practice and what is the evidence for this?\nSo, as I suggested earlier, the evidence is that it’s a bit historical, and most people would actually say about six centimeters. I think that can be brought down a little bit for connective tissue patients and can go up a little bit for atheromatous patients. But in general, you’re talking about a younger segment of patients. This is not an operation for people in their eighties. Outcomes stratified by age greater than 50 found a higher rate of death, paraplegia, renal failure, cardiac complications and length of stay.(Coselli et al. 2017) These patients need to be in very good shape because it is a big onslaught physiologically on them. It’s not just getting them off the table, it’s getting them out of intensive care and out of hospital and to recover back to their baseline.\nI think that’s one of the things that can be really difficult about this disease. You are taking patients who are effectively functioning quite well, and they’re often relatively asymptomatic and you’re putting them through a prophylactic operation to try and prevent rupture, which no one quite knows if or when it’ll happen.\nSo to that end, can you talk us through the decision making process when you’re assessing a patient with a thoracoabdominal aneurysm types 1, 2, 3, or 5?\nI think it is really dependent on anatomy, physiology, and the patient in front of you. Unfortunately, it is a bit of a bespoke assessment for an individual patient. So firstly, I think you have got to look at what are the options for that patient, which goes from conservative to endovascular, to open surgery.\nThe endovascular domain has changed hugely now with the increasing availability of branched devices. When I started, there weren’t custom devices. There were some FEVAR devices just coming out, and we did use long covered stents going through devices with TEVAR above. However, there wasn’t the option for what we’ve now got from an endovascular perspective.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake a Listen\n\n\n\nThe availability of fenestrated and branched devices is very different between the United Kingdom, Europe and the United States. In the UK, custom fenestrated and branched devices have received CE mark approval, which is similar to FDA approval in the United States. These devices do not have FDA approval in the United States, so access to them is far more limited.\nCheck out our conversation with Dr. Gustavo Oderich where we discuss the advances in endovascular techniques for branched and fenestrated devices in the United States.\nCheck out our conversation with Dr. Benjamin Starnes where we discuss the process of an investigation device exemption (IDE), which is how the majority of custom devices are performed in the United States.\n\n\nSo I think you’ve got to choose the patients that are either unsuitable for endovascular, or are we really going to benefit from a durability of an open approach. Those are the two big differences, and they are differences. One, you’re going for gold standard approach because you think they’re life expectancy warrants that. The other one is much higher risk, because they haven’t got another endovascular option. These range from people with very tortuous anatomy, to difficult renal arteries, such as early divisions, that make them unsuitable as target vessels. Another reason is complex dissections, which are not suitable for an endovascular approach. Therefore, it is quite variable, but the first thing you must consider is whether this patient is going to get through this and get out of hospital. And that really is looking at them in the eye and considering what’s their quality of life or what’s their family support, and are they up for this?\nThe second one then is anatomical difficulties— Is there a shaggy aorta, atheromatous disease, or calcification of a target vessel, etc. Severe aortic wall thrombus is associated with solid organ infarction (24%), acute kidney injury, without dialysis (21%) and delayed oral intake by 3.4d, however rarely resulted in mortality (0.5%).(Ribeiro et al. 2017) Rarely is this a hundred percent or 0% decision, but it’s about building up relative contraindications. Some of them are pretty simple, like access problems for endovascular, and it’s a combination of those which then will sway you in one way or the other. And if anything, that decision-making is probably more pertinent for type III and type IV, where there really is a different option and these patients are n their sixties and seventies with classic atheromatous disease. The really, young fit non-connective tissue patient with a type II TAAA is a rare beast.\nFor connective tissue disease, many textbooks prefer an open approach over an endovascular approach do you still agree with this?\nYes, I do. I think certainly, what were you know about patients who’ve had total endovascular approaches for connective tissue diseases is that they don’t last. They may last five years or so and then you get progressive aortic dilatation and loss of those of seal zones. Whether that is the natural history of the native disease or whether it is regional force hooks, barbs or whatever is related to the device is unclear.\nBut when you sew these pensions and just touching the back end of a needle on the anterior wall can create a massive problem or just being a little bit clumsy and you get a radial tear. It’s very clear that a stiff device sitting in those aortas for many years with 60-70 beats per minute going through it and often hypertension, isn’t going last.\nHowever there are some caveats, as I mentioned earlier, bridging between previous prosthetic open repairs is a possibility. And sometimes in a lifesaving situation, such as when someone has presented with a rupture, you may have to use an endovascular approach. However, be prepared then to treat that as a bridge and go back to do a definitive repair when things have calmed down and in the cold light of day.\nSo we don’t really have the scope to dive into complex endovascular repair in this episode, but can you describe the broad principles of your operative approach to open thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair?\nIn terms of the patient, for anything juxtarenal or type IV, I tend to have a patient supine on their back, but with a break in the table at the level between the costal margin and the anterior superior iliac spine. By breaking the table at that level, you can increase the exposure to that segment of the aorta.\nHowever, there are some patients even with a type IV repair that demand a left thoracoabdominal incision. For a type four, if you’re doing a left thoracoabdominal approach, it’s usually for someone with a very narrow acute angle of the costal margin, such as a more petite frame female patient or a crus that is very high on the aorta. And if you look at CT scans, which is something I’ve realized over many years, that not everyone is the same. So where the celiac and SMA are can be in a different proportion, depending on where the costal margin and and skeleton is, which can make them easier or harder to get to. And certainly in a situation, if there is a rupture within the left side of the abdomen, you wouldn’t really want to go into that without getting proximal control. Because as you do the visceral rotation, you could have catastrophic bleeding.\nSo under those circumstances, I’d also go into the left chest with a reasonably low segment so that you can place a clamp ready before doing the visceral rotation. So for type IV the one above then, the higher you go, the higher your thoracotomy and the more tipped over you need the patient. So for a type II, you’re going probably fifth intercostal space and the shoulders are at 90 degrees and the pelvis is 60 degrees. For type three, you’re slightly further over, so you’re down to about 60 degrees and you’re perhaps in the seventh intercostal space. So the lower you go, then right up to being pretty much supine.\nThe left arm is put over top. You mark the scapular and you go into the chest and abdomen. I tend to go intraperitonealy into the abdomen, so I can see the bowel, although there are people who do a retroperitoneal approach. I tend to divide the diaphragm down to the central ligament and mark that. Then effectively you are looking at your clamp zone. You dissect around your clamp zone, both proximally and distally. We don’t tend to expose the celiac and SMA in particular, or the right renal. It’s important to find the left renal artery. For the visceral rotation, you effectively extend the left colon up, find the white line and get under that and get right onto psoas. The key is to get right down on the psoas early on, and then it is a relatively bloodless field. Everything has taken medially to leave the ureters out of the way. I always take for left kidney up. You will see in the textbooks and some advocate to keep the left kidney down. I that’s utter madness to be honest and I can’t see any point in it.\nSo for me, everything rotates up then out of the way. And it it looks a bit strange, like a postmortem. It looks very odd to see the whole left side abdominal cavity when all you’ve got is diaphragm muscle, psoas muscle and nothing else left. It does give you a very safe exposure then to the aorta. I don’t tend to go round the aorta with slings, I think that can cause problems. I go around with my fingers and be very aware of the right sided lumbers or intercostals because you really don’t want to cause a problem there because you can’t easily get into the right chest from that exposure. So you have to be a bit careful so you can see exactly where you’re getting round.\nSo in specifically with a type II TAAA, many people establish a left heart bypass. Do you always operate in that way and do you use a cardiac surgeon and the setting?\nI think type II you are mandated to have some sort of adjunct to keep the rest of the body perfused while you’re doing the proximal anastomosis. I think in an elective setting left heart bypass is the right way forward, because it does give you more flexibility and it allows you then to sequentially clamp and keep the legs, the viscera or the kidneys perfused. There are some negative aspects to left heart bypass, though, in terms of needing a much higher ACT and bleeding is the enemy here. The more you anti-coagulate, the more problems you’ve got. It’s also not pulsatile flow and you’re putting all your cells through a pump and you’ve got to be aware of increased problems around stroke and everything else that goes with that. I think it is very convenient for that set up, because you can get to the inferior pulmonary vein quite easily and femoral cannulation is quite easy for you to return and then you’ve got the option then of individually cannulating celiac and SMA for perfusion, whereas usually renals are cooled down.\nIf you’ve got a perfusionist there as well, you can get cold perfusate for the renal arteries. So it gives you more flexibility, and if things go wrong, you’ve then got an option to switch to conventional bypass if needed or even drain out and go to circulatory arrest and cool-down.\nHowever, in a more emergency setting, an approach that tends to work quite well for us is to do an ax-fem approach. You use an ax-fem graft onto the right subclavian artery, not tunneled but on the outside of a body onto the right femoral and use the other limb as a single cannula, usually for the SMA, because the SMA is the king vessel with all of this. Most of the other things can go, but if you lose the SMA, you’ve got a dead patient. And that allows you to do an emergency procedure, a mid type III approach, without some of the problems associated with left heart bypass. It allows you to have a lower ACT; it gives you pulsatile flow; you’re not smashing your cells up all the time; and it’s relatively quick and straightforward to do. You don’t have to mobilize a perfusionist and everything else that goes with that. It’s worked well for us in emergency settings. It’s better than a clamp and go approach because with a clamp and go approach, for the type III repair, you need to complete in 15 minutes, your inlay anastomosis at the top, the clock is already on. If you get down to the visceral segment and you’ve got to do some removal of thrombus to get your Carrel patch on or you’ve got to reimplant the left kidney separately, it’s a lot of time pressure and there’s no opportunity for something to go wrong there. That’s where this gives you a bit more breathing space that you’ve got the lower body perfused while you’re doing your proximal anastomosis.\n\n7.2.3.1 Complications\nAs you’ve mentioned, open repair is a high tariff, high risk operation, but apart from death, what are the specific complications to the open approach?\nThe big problems are bleeding and clamp times. Those are the things that cause problems for those patients who survive. So problems with large transfusion which cause problems with ventilation afterwards. The most common complications after a TAAA are pulmonary with 8.5% of one cohort requiring a tracheostomy.(Coselli et al. 2016) Renal ischemia is an issue of people will quote a 40 to 50 minute renal warm ischemic time, you increase your risk of renal failure. They may need to go on the hemofilter for temporary support, but these patients have already lost a lot of nephrons, so they haven’t got a huge amount of capacity to lose more. That’s why eGFR or high creatinine is a really important prognostic marker of outcome in this patients. I think it’s like a barometer on their micro-circulation.\nThe big one and the Achilles heel of these approaches, whether it’s endovascular or open is spinal cord ischemia and that is because of the segmental of blood supply to the cord comes from all the intercostals and lumbers. If you’ve got that aneurysm extending both proximally and distally involving the internal iliacs the left subclavian, then you’re taking out your crucial collateral supply. Important aspects to reduce ischemia include:\n\nGetting the legs back in circuit early, whether that’s removing the large sheaths, during a endovascular repair or getting the leg supply earlier in an open approach.\nKeeping the left subclavian in circuit.\nMaintain the mean arterial pressure in theater\nPlace a spinal drain and ensure it is working.\n\nPost TEVAR leg weakness needs to undergo urgent evaluation. Differential diagnosis includes spinal ischemia due to subclavian or intercostal artery coverage, distal embolization or stenosis of the TEVAR graft. Stenosis should be treated with angioplasty and extension.(Buth et al. 2007)\nSo the major issue is the spinal cord ischemia, can you explain in more detail the blood supply for the spinal cord and how this plays into the occurrence of spinal cord ischemia?\nSo it’s complicated actually. There are anterior and posterior spinal arteries, but I think depending on what level you are in the cord, they get a blood supply from a more dominant approach. So higher up in the cord—cervical and higher thoracic—vertebral arteries are important, so hence the importance of a left subclavian bypass.\nThe lower you go, then they become a bit less important and the actual segmental arteries, intercostals, become dominant. Much is talked about the artery of Adamkiewicz. I think, yes, there may be a dominant vessel at about the level of the 9th-12th intercostal, but it’s rarely one, absolutely single one that if you preserve that one, then the rest don’t matter. I think they all matter.\nAnd then the more distally you go, collateral supply from internal iliacs, median sacral, all those contribute to a collateral circulation that should be seen in some ways all connected. And that is why, more recently in endovascular approaches, staging repair is really useful because you can allow the surviving arteries then to remodel and increase flow. It’s why, during a type II repair, when you get the whole aorta open, it’s very important to block the intercostals early—either by sewing them off or putting a little Pruitt balloon in and to stop losing blood from that collateral supply. It keeps the pressure in the spinal cord. Also the differential position of that blood supply is why patients then get a particularly prominant motor problems and sometimes preservation of sensation.\nSo purely for exam purposes and a bit of physiology. Can you remind us how to calculate the spinal cord perfusion?\nAll that is really is MAP minus the CSF pressure. So it’s your mean arterial pressure, take out the CSF pressure and that’s what you’ve got perfusing the spinal cord. It is a useful equation to remember because it allows you to decide what’s the way to enhance spinal perfusion as much as possible, which is to increase MAP and decrease your CSF pressure. We do that by enhancing the mean arterial pressure as much as possible, and draining off CSF with a spinal drain to reduce your CSF pressure and allow more blood into the cord.\nI think people perhaps get a bit hung up on spinal drainage and it’s importance. It is just as important to maintain oxygenation and hemoglobin over 100 (which is equal to 10 g/dL in the USA), reduce blood loss and all those other things are as crucial. Spinal drainage is an adjunct, but it shouldn’t be seen in isolation. It’s one of many adjuncts to try and help prevent spinal ischemia.\nSo in regards to the mechanism for spinal cord ischemia during open thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair, do you think it’s related the blood loss, clamp time or or implantation of the intercostals?\nI think it’s multifactorial. So I think the majority is due to ischemia scheme in terms of a watershed situation. Segments of a cord just not getting enough blood. And the very reason the more typical area around T7, 8, 9, to 10, is because it is in the middle between the vertebral artery and internal iliac artery supply. This is probably a kin to a splenic flexure of the colon, it’s between two territories.\nHowever, there is also potentially problems with microemboli or trashing of a spinal arteries, which can occur in some patients. It’s a slightly confusing situation, but I think in terms of intraoperatively—blood loss, dumps in blood pressure, with hypotensive episodes really don’t help.\nWhen do you remiplant intercostal arteries?\nAgain, that is a bit confusing. Some people would argue if there’s massive back bleeding, you don’t need to be reimplant because they’re getting collateral supply from somewhere.\nI think it will depend on how the case is going. We do use motor evoked potentials (MEPs) but that’s quite a specialist situation and you’re very reliant on the readings you get. They can be confused by leg ischemia, cooling down or edema. But if you have already got the legs back in circuits and got the MAP up and things weren’t improving and there was a sizable intercostals that could be reimplanted, well, then that’s worth doing. And that’s why the technique of using Pruitt balloon occlusion methods in pairs rather than ligating is good because you can then just reimplant those. If you don’t need to implant them, you can just ligate and remove them. Whereas if you’ve already ligated them, you’ve got a problem because you’ve already destroyed the ostia.\nWe tend to leave a branch already attached in the mid thoracic aorta to save an anastomosis. You can, if you’ve got really good intercostals, fillet the branch to open it up and sew it on like a long patch longitudinally along the paired intercostals and then plumb it back on the other end so it’s a circuit in series with your main aortic graft. That probably decreases the resistance to flow and that might remain patent for a bit longer, rather than having a big 10mm graft going into a single pair of intercostals with what are likely to have quite a high resistance, and they probably don’t last as long.\nSeveral spinal protection protocols have been described to reduce risk of spinal ischemia or mitigate the impact of spinal ischemia in patients who develop weakness.(Estrera et al. 2009; Yanase et al. 2012) An easy way to remember the important components are COPS:\n\nC - Cerebral spine drain status - keep for 7 days, pressure less than 5\nO - Oxygen delivery - supplemental oxygen, increase hgb, increase cardiac index\nPS - Patient Status - Keep BP greater than a MAP of 90mmHg\n\nSo do you think we’re good at predicting preoperatively who may get spinal cord ischemia? You mentioned a few risk factors already that can predict who will or won’t post-operatively.\nI think we’re utterly hopeless at it actually. I really don’t think that there’s a good method. You can see people having an infrarenal repair getting paralysis and you can completely replace the whole aorta from the arch down to the iliacs with prosthetic and have people walking around without a problem at all. So I don’t really understand it and I think that comes into the business about whether it is about emboli, flow, or collaterals. I think it’s a combination of things. When people started embolizing intercostals preoperatively prior to endo repairs, people thought this is a mad thing—you want to keep them perfused surely. But I think it does show the importance of maximizing the collateral supply, and I think some people have a better collateral supply than others. And of course, what we don’t know is when you get down to the more microscopic level of actual arterial supply at cord level, what that is like in an individual patient that you can’t see on imaging. If that is already compromised, I suspect those patients are more at risk than whether they have a macro vascular problem when things go wrong terms of hypotension or blood loss.\nMany reports state that the highest risk factor for spinal cord ischemia includes length of aortic coverage or repair, followed by whether they have had a prior repair, preop hemoglobin, and intraoperative hypotension.(Bisdas et al. 2015)\nWe haven’t really touched on complex endovascular repairs yet, but can you explain when you might choose a hybrid approach to this thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair?\nSo visceral hybrid operation came in really as a bridge between open surgery and endovascular. This is a bit dated now, because it is before custom devices and we only had thoracic stents at this time, the era of the Talent stent, which was a very early thoracic device made by Medtronic. Perhaps not the perfect name because it wasn’t a particularly talented, it was a difficult thing to deploy, but it actually got us into the thoracic aorta. What we realized was that if you could operate in one cavity, such as the abdomen, but still excluding any aneurysm in the chest without cross camping and without rendering that patient ischemic over a large part of their body—they could withstand that hit much better than open cavity surgery with cross clamp and massive reperfusion.\nSo the concept of a visceral hybrid was to do an extra-anatomical bypass of the celiac, SMA and both renals from either the distal aorta or the iliac vessels. So patients would only get sequential ischemia of one organ at a time, say the right kidney or the celiac territory, and during that 10 minute anastomosis, the remainder of the body and organs were refused. And finally, at the end that, you could then put in a thoracic device as a freebie, because you’d already perfused the organs from distally. You’d ligated those target vessels and then you would just excluding the aneurysm so that you were transferring blood from above the repair to below the repair and perfusing the vital organs retrograde.\nSo it was very attractive and we started doing it quite early at St. Mary’s and initially we had some very good results in the first 30 or so patients.(Jenkins et al. 2011) And as always, then it allowed you to consider older, sicker patients but it wasn’t easy surgery. And actually I think because it was doable in terms of just an abdominal approach and relatively familiar territory for anyone who’s done occlusive disease for the viscerals or renals, I think a number of centers started doing small numbers and not getting so good results. And then when better, custom made devices came in, I think it’s purpose became less and less because why would you do that if you had an opportunity to do something which was even less invasive.\nSo what we’ve been left with now to consider a hybrid type approach effectively are those patients who are physiologically not fit enough for an open approach and those patients who are anatomically not suitable for a total endovascular approach. In some ways, they are the worst of both worlds in that outcome group. And so I don’t think you’ll ever be able to compare outcomes legitimately with the fitter group having a fully open approach and the anatomically suitable patients having a total endovascular.\nBut I must say we still see quite a lot in our multidisciplinary reviews coming back. What surprises me is the durability of those grafts. The visceral grafts remain patent for many years, some of them are 15 years now. Occasionally there will be an accessory or small diseased renal artery, and the renal graft will go down, but the others have been extremely durable. And even though we’ve had to re-line the stenting portion or extend it, the grafts have maintained really well.\nA unique situation that uses a similar technique is with mycotic aneurysms of the visceral segment of the aorta. The mainstay of treatment is a debranching of the aorta and debridement of the infected aorta with in situ revascularization or ax fem-fem bypass. There is an evolving role for FEVAR, such as with most aneurysmal disease.(Sörelius et al. 2016; Sule and Dharmaraj 2016)\nSo moving on to Type IV thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair. These can be repaired using endovascular or open techniques. Can you talk us through your approach to open Type IV repair in terms of exposure and any tips such as how to minimize the visceral ischemia?\nSo I think an open Type IV from a subcostal approach is a doable and durable procedure. And what I mean by that is that the hit to the patient is not enormous, and a reasonably fit patient can get through that reasonably well. You have to be a little bit selective, but not super selective. For example, in my first hundred, I had one 30 day death and one in hospital death, which was someone at about three months who just didn’t get better, so that puts it into perspective that actually it’s an operation with a very good outcome, if you get it right at the beginning.\nThe approach I mentioned earlier, nothing too special. This is a supine patient. Getting the break on the table in the right position to allow you to extend the abdomen. You lower both ends of a table to open up that segment of the abdomen and get better exposure. I tend to do the vast majority via a subcostal approach, some people would call it rooftop, then extending on the left side down below the costal margin a bit. And it gives you really good exposure even if you have to go down to the iliacs. It does cause a bit more of a problem getting to the right iliac bifurcation. The left is easy, because it’s right there next to you. So that’s an added complication.\nThe visceral rotation needs to be done carefully because what you do not want is to create blood loss right at beginning. And as I mentioned earlier, it’s getting under the left colon along the white line onto psoas and then getting up under psoas and I always tell the registrars when they’re doing it, you’ve got to go as far as possible on psoas from below. And when you think you’ve gone as far as possible, you’ve got to go another five centimeters. So you get right up to the diaphragm from below. And then you can get into the supra-colic compartment around the splenic flexure and get your fingers either side of the lienorenal ligament and take that off the lateral and the posterior abdominal wall. The more and more you do, the more you are freeing and the whole of the viscera comes up towards the right side of a patient and eventually they will rotate up and you’ve exposed the whole left wall of the aorta.\nThe first thing I then do is ensure that I’ve got a clamp zone, and I do that by dividing the crus which sometimes can be really tense at that level. The crus can act as an extrinsic wrap around the dilated aorta, to an extent that the distal end of the crus is almost ligamentous, causing a tight band on the aorta. I tend to get my finger underneath that before it with a diathermy and opening it, and then very carefully choosing the clamp zone and getting my fingers right round that area, so I know I’ve got a healthy clamp zone.\nThe next thing I then do is look for the left renal artery. I’ve already tended to make a decision about what I’m going to do with the left renal artery, which depends on the number of things. So it depends on, to some extent, the age of a patient, where the left renal is in terms of a clock face. So if you’re looking at an axial cut to the CT, the more the left renal is around before three o’clock, up to two o’clock, the easier it is to incorporate because you’ve got less aortic tissue there. If the left renal is beyond 3:30 and posterior on the sidewall of the aorta or if the left renal is more distal compared to the right renal, then it’s a long way away from the right renal artery and you’re going be leaving a larger patch of aorta. This is usually bad news, unless you have a more elderly patient.\nYou’re making this decision about whether you’re going to try and incorporate the left renal artery into a big patch or whether you’re going to reimplant it separately or perform a jump graft. So you’ve already thought about that, but it’s crucial to find the left renal because when you’ve clamped and you’ve done your left aortotomy, you’ve got to get that aortotomy underneath and posterior to the left renal artery so that the orifice goes up with that segment of the aorta.\nThen I tend to get the iliacs out. The left is easy, it’s there. I have no qualms on the right by going back over through the peritoneum to find the right iliac artery to expose that. I don’t go around any of them. I just find a very discrete camp zone. You don’t need much, just enough to put a clamp on.\nAnd then I tend to take the fat and lymphatic tissue off the left side of aorta. So when you open the aorta, you’ve not got a lot of immediate bleeding. If you’ve got a retro-aortic left renal vein, you’ve got a line gate that cause otherwise you’d be going through it. And surprisingly, on CT, the main left renal vein is anterior, but there is often a vein there which has stretched across, either a lumbar or phrenic vein, which you should deal with prior to your aortotomy.\nIt’s about getting everything set up before you cross clamp, because once you cross clamp, the clock is on. So it’s getting the whole team ready for that moment and making your anatomy as perfect as possible before you do that. Obviously it goes without saying that you have cell salvage and we use a Belmont with the big bucket on the top of it, so that you can rapidly give blood back when you need it.\nCan you talk a little bit more about a Carrel patch and when would you choose to do a jump graft to the left renal rather than encompass all the vessel vessels onto that patch?\nI tend to think of a Carrel patch more in a way with a type III repair, because with a type III repair, you’ve done your proximal anastomosis and then what you’re doing is you’re putting on a patch of aorta to include the celiac, SMA, and right renal, which tend to be together, whereas sometimes the left renal is a bit away. The more tissue you leave there, the more chance that aortic tissue will dilate to over time, hence the patch aneurysm. If your patient has got some form of connective tissue disease, we reimplant directly.(De Rango et al. 2011; Afifi et al. 2017) There is a very nice graft available with four side bunches already put on and you can go straight onto the ostia. So you’re basically leaving no aortic tissue at all.\nFor type IV, you are doing an oblique anastomosis and you have to be aware that the right side of the aorta is really left there. It’s a compromise, these patients with atherosclerotic type IV aneurysms, they may be in their sixties, seventies or even into their eighties. Even the good candidates, they’re not going to live 25-30 years, and therefore over time that segment may begin to dilate a bit. I think that is acceptable. Half of that segment is Dacron and the other bit may dilate.\nI think if you’ve got a Carrel patch, which really balloons out, that’s something which is different. We don’t have good data as to when those will give away and rupture. I think what is clear is that if you’ve got dehiscence between your suture line and your graft, that is a dangerous situation, akin to a false aneurysm. And although it may look similar on CT, that’s a different beast and they’re at risk at any stage. True aneurysmal dilation of a segment that is left behind is a bit different and I think that’s a bit safer. In essence, what you’re trying to do is a compromise between leaving as little aortic tissue as possible, but also getting the patient alive through their first repair safely.\nIf I know I’m not going to incorporate a left renal, then I will sew on a six or eight millimeter side branch onto the tube golf before I cross clamp, because that saves you one anastomosis. And then now my favorite technique is just to amputate the left renal artery and sew that directly onto your branch and leave that in a bit of a lazy C configuration in the paracolic gutter, so as the rotation comes back, it’s not under tension. The other technique is to have very short graft, right from your aortic prosthetic, but you’ve got to really judge how that will sit when the kidney is back in its anatomic position. So it can’t come off the anterior aspect of the tube graft. It needs to be further down and that’s awkward to judge and I think we’re probably not good at that so the lazy C is a better approach.\nI much prefer that to trying to either reimplant the native artery directly onto the Dacron, as they tend to restenose or try to bring the aortic sidewall down on to the Dacron. I think that’s fraught with difficulty. You’ve often got calcification at the ostium, and it’s also very difficult because you’ve got the rest of your anastomosis really close and sometimes not enough room to bring your clamp down, which is exactly what you want to do. The left kidney will take a bit of an extra ischemic hit, but you want to be perfuse the right renal and viscera. You’ve got to have to bring your camp down below your proximal anastomosis.\nWhen it comes to late complications from TAAA repair, 8% are from progression of aortic disease and 3% are related to the graft repair. Risk factors associated with late events include female sex, partial aneurysm resection, expansion of remaining native aorta or initial aneurysm rupture.(Clouse et al. 2003)\nHave you ever had to treat the Carrel patch aneurysm in your career?\nWe have a number from previous Type III repairs and I think these are very suitable for fenestrated or branched devices. You’ve got a beautiful lending zone, proximally and distally. Why not? These tend to be well-suited to that and it’s a much easier approach mixing endo and open, changing from one to the other, I think that’s fine. It’s just at a different stage of a patient’s life and repair\nAny final summary or closing words about aortic surgery?\nWe have a bit of a tipping point with open aortic surgery at the moment, certainly in the UK. Looking at registry data, many are tipping back to open now. Whether that was as a result of NICE guidelines, I suspect not, perhaps that just put it more into focus. I think many people are seeing more problems with patients surviving after what was very good endovascular surgery at the time, but they’ve outlived the repair. Now we’ve got problems with patients where you got to wonder whether that wasn’t perfect anatomy and should they have had open surgery?\nNow the difficulty we’ve got at the moment is the patients that perhaps weren’t that suited for endovascular repair, did well initially from it and they are paying the price later on. But those very patients are the ones that are also more difficult from an open approach. They are patients with shorter, more tortuous necks or more calcification. There is a concern that there is an era of surgeons now that haven’t done as much open aortic surgery, who may not be as confident with adverse anatomy.\nThat lack of confidence influences your decision-making, so patients don’t get a full appraisal of what options are available. The default then may be to go with a less than perfect endovascular option. I agree, this may be less easy to kill a patient upfront with an endo option but you perhaps pay for that later on. This is a very difficult thing to get around and we’ve got to get to a compromise of finding the patients with the likely better life expectancy and sending them to groups with a larger open practice and get them through a big operation safely and capitalize on those benefits.\nThe really lucky ones are the ones that are anatomically really suited for endovascular repair and their sack really shrinks and their seal zones remain good. They are the best of both worlds as they tend to also be fitter with less extensive disease and get the benefits from a less invasive approach. Not all patients are the same and we’ve got to now accept that we’ve gone down the line of working with industry, which they didn’t necessarily focus on durability. What they wanted to do is to extend the applicability, to treat more patients and get better, lower profile devices to go for these percutaneous cardiology market in the United States. And we’re now paying the price of some of those decisions, so we’ve got to reboot and take a stance on which patients are going to actually benefit from which approach and have a better evaluation of that going forward.\n\n\n\n\nAfifi, Rana O., Akiko Tanaka, Ibrahim Yazji, Hazim J.

    "text": "8.1 General Considerations\nWhat are the common genetic aortopathies?\nThere are several well-known genetic disorders which account for genetic aortopathies. The most well-known are Marfan syndrome, Loeys-Dietz Syndrome, and Vascular Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome.\nThere are less commonly known ones such as Familial Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms and Dissections due to pathogenic variants smooth muscle cells genes such as ACTA2. There are others in which the causative gene is not known.(Black 2019)\nWhy are they such a big deal?\nThese are cases in which the building blocks of the aortic wall are defective. What I mean by this, is that these patients have pathogenic variants in the genes that affect cell signaling or smooth muscle cell structure that lead to suboptimal composition of the aortic wall. These alterations ultimately lead to cystic medial necrosis in the aortic wall.\nAs such they are at more risk for aortic aneurysms and dissections that can lead to the premature death of the patient.\nTo put the frequency in perspective, Marfan syndrome occurs in 1:5000 of the population while Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (also known as VEDS) occur in 1:50000 of the population.\nLet’s dive into them then – what are the defining features of each and the high yield information?\nThe high yield information is being able to pair the genetic syndrome and phenotype with its associated genetic mutation. A useful exercise following this broadcast is to list the disorders in a table and write out their associated gene mutation, what protein defect or deficit occurs, the typical phenotype, and the common vascular pathology associated.\nBut before we dive in, I want you to keep in mind some of shared features. One is that the associated aneurysms and dissections tend to occur at younger ages and dissect at lower blood pressures than what we see with sporadic dissections (these are the dissections that are not familial or associated with a syndrome)\nOne is that these are inherited in an autosomal dominant matter but there can be variation in how the pathogenic variants are expressed among affected people and even within families. The other thing to remember, is that in roughly half of these cases, the affected patient is the first in their family to have a given pathogenic mutation. The flip side of this, is in half the cases, there is a family history of aortic aneurysms, dissections, and sudden death."

    "section": "8.2 Demographics",
    "text": "8.2 Demographics\nWe will start with Marfan syndrome.\nMarfan syndrome is caused by pathogenic variants in the FBN1 gene (also known as fibrillin-1 gene). These variants lead to improper formation of the microfibrils that maintain elastin, a key component of the arterial wall.\nThese patients are prone to aneurysmal degeneration and dissections of the aortic root but can also dissect the descending thoracic aorta. They commonly have lens dislocations (ectopia lentis). They have common skeletal features such as being tall, thin, with long arms and legs, scoliosis, pectus deformities (carnitatum or excavatum), and club feet. They can also have a history of spontaneous pneumothorax and mitral valve prolapse.\nHow is Marfan syndrome similar or different from the other genetically triggered aortopathies that you mentioned?\nLoeys Dietz Syndrome is similar to Marfan syndrome in all the features including the aortic root aneurysms. They don’t seem to have lens dislocation and they have other unique features such as bifid uvula or cleft palate, and hypertelorism (which is an abnormally increased distance between the eyes). What is different about Loeys Dietz Syndrome from Marfan syndrome is that they can have arterial aneurysms of other arteries instead of the aorta, such as the SMA, axillary, or other peripheral arteries.\nVascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome has some shared features to Marfan Syndrome with both such as spontaneous pneumothorax, but these patients tend to be short and can have easy bruising. They also have similar features to Loeys Dietz syndrome in terms of arterial aneurysms. Common features of VEDS would be thin translucent skin where you can easily see their veins, thin lips, thin bridge of the nose, large eyes, easy bruising, acrogeria – or an aged appearance of the hands\nHowever, unlike Marfan and Loeys-Dietz, the majority of VEDS patients tend to not have aortic root aneurysms. One thing to remember about VEDS is that it is a subtype of Ehlers Danlos syndromes. It’s very important to distinguish it from the other subtypes because most of the other 12 Ehlers-Danlos syndromes are not associated with arterial pathology. So people with vascular EDS are prone to arterial, uterine, and intestinal rupture and their average lifespan is 48 due to these highly morbid pathologies. 25% of patients with vEDS will have experienced some clinical manifestation by age 20, and that number is close to 90% by age 40.\nI remember learning about classic Ehlers-Danlos presenting with hypermobile skin and joints. Is this something you see with Vascular EDS as well?\nPatient’s with vEDS don’t have the same hypermobile skin or joint laxity as we classically think of with classic Ehlers-Danlos. In fact, some vEDS patients report losing confidence in their physicians who ask them about joint and skin hypermobility because it suggests to them that their doctor doesn’t know about their disease process. These patients often know more than most of the doctors they meet about their condition, and it’s a source of constant frustration for them. It can also be a problem if the severity of the disease is underestimated, as we discussed they can present much younger than most patients with highly morbid issues – like arterial rupture.\nYou mentioned arterial pathology in Loeys-Dietz and vEDS. Can you tell me more about that?\nIn both types you can see subclavian, carotid, SMA, and iliac artery aneurysms and dissections, as well as less frequently vertebral, SFA, and popliteal aneurysms and dissections."

    "text": "8.3 Evaluation\nHow do you diagnose these genetically triggered aortopathies?\nThere are clinical diagnostic criteria for each, but ultimately genetic and laboratory testing is very important for the final diagnosis.\nGhent criteria is used to clinically diagnose Marfan syndrome. The big ones are aortic root dilation, known family history of Marfan’s or not, the diagnosis of ectopia lentis which clinically is manifested as iridodonesis (lens shimmering). Additionally, genetic testing for pathogenic FBN1 variants is also diagnostic.\nTo date, there are 5 types of Loeys-Dietz as of last check. These are due to pathogenic variants in the TGF-B signaling pathway, such as TGF-beta receptors and SMAD3 genes.\nVascular EDS is caused by a mutation in the COL3A1 gene which encodes a defective type of III procollagen. The defect in the procollagen makes it unable to properly fold into a triple helix that forms the normal collagen structure. This causes the defective procollagen to be degraded intracellularly and as a result there is an overall deficit in type III collagen which is an important component of arterial walls and other structures. The confirmatory test for VEDS is collagen testing which can confirm the collagen III defect."

    "section": "8.4 Management",
    "text": "8.4 Management\n\n8.4.1 Medical Management\nHow would you manage these patients?\nMedical optimization and surveillance is key to try to extend the time as much as possible before they get a dissection and avoid it if at all possible.\nWe start with lifestyle modification. Avoid “burst” exertions such as sprinting and weight-lifting. Anything that very strenuous. That’s not to say that they shouldn’t exercise. Light exercise is encouraged, but this would be activities like light jogging, swimming laps, or biking.\nIn order to minimize aortic shear stress, a resting heart rate of under 70 beats per minute and an exercising heart rate under 100 should be the goal. This can be accomplished with beta blockers. Propranolol has been shown to significantly decrease the rate of aortic growth in Marfans patients with a baseline aortic root diameter under 4cm. There is research into the use of Losartan in murine models that suggests it inhibits TGF-beta in the aortic wall, which is an important pathway that contributes to the breakdown of the wall. However, randomized controlled studies have failed to show an increased benefit of Losartan over beta blockers in Marfans patients. ACE inhibitors are also being tested and are shown to decrease the risk of type b aortic dissection over 6 years.\nIn vascular EDS instead of propranolol, celiprolol has been studied by the French and shown to reduce vascular rupture from 50 down to 20% in vEDS, although the mechanism of this is not yet clear and does not appear to be necessarily the same as decreasing shear stress as in Marfan’s syndrome.(Ong et al. 2010) In general taking care of these patients involves trying to minimize complications from procedures and interventions. For instance, use ultrasound for any line that is necessary and avoid arterial lines, intramuscular injections, or other invasive lines if possible to minimize the chance of a complication. Patients are advised to wear medical bracelets notifying that they have vEDS.\nWe also discuss the importance of forming a care team based on their needs. This usually includes a cardiologist, a cardiac surgeon, a vascular surgeon, and a primary care physician.\n\n\n8.4.2 Surgery\nWhat about surgical treatment for those who need it?\nFor patients with Marfan’s, prophylactic surgery is recommended for aortic root dilation >5cm or thoracic aorta >5.5cm. Often times the thoracic and abdominal aorta are involved. Open and endovascular surgery are options for these patients. Open procedures often include open thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repairs, open cardiac surgery for arch replacement, or cervical debranching procedures. Endovascular procedures can include regular TEVARs or branched TEVARs which require extensive aortic coverage.\nOpen surgery can be well tolerated and is ideal in the sense that you can replace the entire aorta which avoids the future complications from continued aneurysmal degeneration, loss of proximal or distal seal zones, or device issues that can plague endovascular methods. However open surgery, of course caries higher complication risk and morbidity up front and does share some complications with endovascular treatments as well.\nSometimes these patients will have hybrid procedures and often their care will require multiple surgery teams including cardiac and vascular surgery. An important thing to be up front with all of these patients about is that this is a long term relationship with their surgeon, as they often require multiple staged procedures, things aren’t fixed in one procedure, and even after they have been surgically addressed there is a lifetime of maintenance and surveillance.\nUltimately, the decision for open vs. endovascular approaches will vary between patients based on their specific anatomy and arterial issues, what their body can tolerate, and ultimately what their goals of care are.(Lum et al. 2012) Some may require having their entire aorta replaced, while others may only need ongoing medical therapy and surveillance and it’s important to set expectations early.\nWhat about VEDS, when surgery cannot be avoided? How do you mitigate the risk of complications?\nThe tissue is very fragile. So using instruments that are the least traumatic is key – like fogarty clamps for vessels. Sutures often must be pledgeted to reinforce them. Leave no tension on anastomoses or suture lines. Always keep a backup plan in mind– when arteries cannot be repaired, can they safely be ligated or embolized. Generally any large bore access for endovascular treatment is avoided because access site complications are high and can lead to devastating consequences. Some have described a technique of open exposure and buttressed repair, when endovascular approaches are required.(Black 2019)\nIn situations of extremis, like a rupture, these patients’ tissues have been known to completely breakdown. This is often their first presentation of their aortopathy so there is no time for previously discussed work up or considerations. Try to avoid the worst case scenario, but of course sometimes it’s the only option left to get out of the OR. Be upfront with the patient about how complications may arise, set expectations, and think about goals of care early.\nSome specific considerations for TEVAR in these patients is that it may be important to have cardiac surgery readily available because they are high risk for retrograde dissection. Also, avoid aggressive oversizing, consider not ballooning if no leak is identified and avoid excessive wire manipulation."

    "text": "8.5 Summary\nWe discussed earlier that these aortopathies can have shared phenotypic characteristics, some of which can be used in a clinical diagnosis, but are all of these genetic aortopathies syndromic?\nLet’s start by saying that all patients with Marfan syndrome and VEDS can have the syndromic features we just talked about. However, it’s not always the case and the absence of these feature does not exclude the diagnosis. In fact, we recently treated a middle-aged woman with an aortic dissection who had Marfan Syndrome confirmed with genetic testing. She had been diagnosed prior to her dissection because her daughter had undergone genetic testing. However, on meeting her, I would not have guessed she had Marfan Syndrome, had I not known. She was average height, obese, and had no other relevant physical findings on exam or history.\nThis ties into another genetic aortopathy that we have not discussed yet which are the familial thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections. They do not have any syndromic features. For example, patients with ACTA2 pathogenic variants that cause alpha actin mutations which again contribute to degeneration of the arterial wall. These patients tend to present 10 years younger than sporadic thoracic aortic aneurysms, generally in their late 50s compared to late 60s, and women seem to be less often effected than men.\nDr. Shalhub, I know vascular genetics is one of your passions. Is there anything else you want people to remember from this broadcast?\nDon’t forget the family. Once you’ve made the diagnosis in one of them, remember it is autosomal dominant, so it’s important to make sure the family understands and that they are set up with the appropriate care team and monitoring. They may not all develop the same medical issues, however as we discussed, ongoing medical management and lifestyle changes are the key."

    "section": "10.1 Demographics",
    "text": "10.1 Demographics\nWhat is an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)? (Moore, Lawrence, and Oderich 2019)\n\nDefined as a localized dilation of an artery to a diameter greater than 50% (1.5x) of its normal diameter. It is generally accepted that >3cm in adults is considered aneurysmal for the abdominal aorta.\nAAAs can be described as:\n\nInfrarenal – distal to the renal arteries with normal aorta between the renal arteries and the aneurysm origin.\nJuxtarenal – aneurysm extends to the renal arteries but does not involve them\nPararenal – aneurysm involving the origin of at least one of the renal arteries\n\nEstimated 1.1 million Americans have AAAs, which equates to a prevalence of 1.4% in 50-84 year old general population.\n\nMen 65-75y with a history of smoking have a prevalence of 6-7% - hence the need for screening.(LeFevre and Force 2014; Chaikof, Dalman, Eskandari, Jackson, Lee, Mansour, Mastracci, Mell, Murad, Nguyen, and al. 2018)\nMen without a history of smoking have a prevalence of 2%.\nWomen who are current smokers 2%, and women with a history of smoking 0.8%.(Wanhainen et al. 2006)\n\nAAAs are 3-7x more prevalent than thoracic aortic aneurysms and can co-exist with other aneurysms throughout the arterial vascular system like popliteal artery aneurysms.\n\nIn a 10-year review originating from Ireland, 50% of patients that presented with unilateral popliteal artery aneurysms had associated AAA. In patients with bilateral popliteal aneurysms, 63% of those had associated AAA. (Duffy et al. 1998)\nPatients with femoral aneurysms have an 85% chance of an associated AAA. (Diwan et al. 2000a)\nConversely, if a patient is first found to have a AAA, there is an 11% chance of having associated popliteal artery aneurysms >15mm. (Tuveson, Löfdahl, and Hultgren 2016)\nAnother study showed a rate of femoral-popliteal aneurysms in AAA patients is approximately 14%. (Diwan et al. 2000a)\nThis association stresses the importance of a good physical exam when evaluating a patient with a AAA and is commonly tested on exams.(Chaikof, Dalman, Eskandari, Jackson, Lee, Mansour, Mastracci, Mell, Murad, Nguyen, and al. 2018; Diwan et al. 2000b)\n\n\n\n10.1.1 Etiology\nWhat is the pathogenesis of an abdominal aortic aneurysm? (Moore, Lawrence, and Oderich 2019)\n\nMore than 90% of AAAs are associated with atherosclerosis.\nOther causes include cystic medial necrosis, dissection, Marfan’s syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Loeys-Dietz, HIV and syphilis.\nElastin and collagen are the major structural proteins responsible for the integrity of the aortic wall and defects in these cause degeneration and further aneurysmal change.\nFor example, a mutation in fibrillin in Marfan’s syndrome causes elastin fragmentation and pathological remodeling of the wall of the artery to form cystic medial degeneration.\nSeveral investigations have also shown that upregulation of metalloproteinase activity, specifically MMP-2 and MMP-9, have an essential role in aneurysm formation. Imbalances between aortic wall proteases and antiproteases cause degradation of the extracellular matrix and loss of structural integrity of the aortic wall.\n\nNicotine increases MMP expression in vascular smooth muscle cells.(Li and Dai 2012; Rabkin 2016)\n\nIncreased thrombus burden is associated with wall thinning, medial loss of smooth muscle cells, elastin degradation, adventitial inflammation and aortic wall hypoxia which all increase the rate of AAA growth.\n\nOf note, intraluminal thrombus rarely embolizes and is not an indication for anticoagulation.(Singh et al. 2019; Cameron, Russell, and Owens 2018)\n\nInfective aortitis is a rare but highly morbid cause for aortic aneurysm formation. Treatment in this setting should be more aggressive with the addition of antibiotic therapy and open surgical repair with rifampin soaked graft whenever feasible.(Gornik and Creager 2008; Paravastu et al. 2009; Rasmussen and Hallett 1997)\nFor more about aortitis, see Section 3.3.5\n\nWhat are the risk factors for AAA occurrence and growth? (Moore, Lawrence, and Oderich 2019)\n\nRisk factors for AAAs are similar to the risk factors for occlusive atherosclerosis and include age, tobacco use, hypertension, male gender and hyperlipidemia.\nCigarette smoking is the single most important modifiable risk factor to prevent occurrence and growth of AAAs. Smoking increases the rate of growth by 35% for abdominal aortic aneurysms.\n\nSmoking has a dose dependent relationship with AAA, smoking 1/2 ppd has one third the risk of smoking 1 ppd.(Kent et al. 2010)\n\nIt has been found that diabetes is protective for AAA progression and rupture.\nMen more likely to have AAA, but women develop at a later age with more aggressive growth and risk for rupture. (Lo and Schermerhorn 2016a)\n\nStronger association with smoking in women.\nWomen have same outcomes from endo repair, higher complications from open repair due to poorly managed CV risk factors.\n\nFluoroquinolones(C.-C. Lee et al. 2015, 2018; LeMaire et al. 2018; Pasternak, Inghammar, and Svanström 2018) - In a recent study just published in JAMA Surgery in January 2021, the group at UNC showed an increased short-term risk of developing an aortic aneurysm with fluoroquinolone use. (Newton et al. 2021)\n\nThey reviewed all prescription fills for fluoroquinolones or comparative antibiotics from 2005-2017.\nThis included >27 million US Adults aged 18-64 years old with no history of aneurysms.\n18% of the prescriptions were fluoroquinolones.\nFluoroquinolones were associated with increased incidence of aortic aneurysms. Compared to the other antibiotics, fluoroquinolones were associated with a higher 90-day incidence of AAA and iliac aneurysms as well as more likely to undergo aneurysm repair.\nThey recommended that fluoroquinolone use should be pursued with caution in all adults, not just high risk individuals, and they recommended broadening of the warnings from the FDA.\nFluoroquinolones playing a role in dissections and aneurysm formation is often a highly tested question\n\nMedical therapy has been studied with disappointing results. Beta-blockers and ACE/ARB inhibitors have been studied but have not shown any effect on growth of AAAs.\n\nWhat is the dreaded complication of AAA?\n\nAneurysm rupture is the fear with a diagnosis of AAA. The risk of rupture increases yearly as the aneurysm expands. Once an aneurysm develops, it tends to enlarge gradually yet progressively. This is an important concept to grasp for testing.(Lindsay 2019a; Tracci, Roy, and Upchurch, n.d.)\nGrowth rate\n\nFor smaller aneurysms (3-5cm in size), the growth rate is approximately 2-3mm/year\nFor larger aneurysms (>5cm), the growth rate is higher at 3-5mm/year.\n\nRupture risk, historically, has been described as:\n\n\nHistorical reporting of AAA rupture risk(Tracci, Roy, and Upchurch, n.d.)\n\n\nAAA Size\nCumulative Annual Rupture Risk\n\n\n\n\n3-3.9 cm\n0.3%\n\n\n4-4.9 cm\n0.5-1.5%\n\n\n5-5.9 cm\n1-11%\n\n\n6-6.9 cm\n11-22%\n\n\n>7 cm\n>30%\n\n\n\n\nNewer data suggests the true rupture risk per year is decreasing with time. Rupture risk has recently been reported to be much lower.\n\nA systematic review from the UK published in JVS in 2015, the rupture risks were far lower than previously reported and what is documented in most textbooks. Data included 11 studies, reviewing 1514 patients, published between 1995 and 2014.(Parkinson et al. 2015)\n\n\n\nAAA rupture risk based on most recent publications\n\n\nAAA Size\nCumulative Annual Rupture Risk\n\n\n\n\n<5.5 cm\n<1%(Oliver-Williams et al. 2019)\n\n\n5.5-6.0 cm\n3.5% [0-9%](Parkinson et al. 2015)\n\n\n6.1-7.0 cm\n4.1% [0-9%](Parkinson et al. 2015)\n\n\n>7.0 cm\n6.3% [0-14%](Parkinson et al. 2015)\n\n\n\n\nFactors that increase the risk of rupture other than the size of the aneurysm are smoking, COPD, hypertension, transplant recipient, and rapid enlargement (defined as 1 cm/year or more)."

    "text": "10.2 Evaluation\nWhat is the work up for a AAA? (Moore, Lawrence, and Oderich 2019)\n\n75% of all infrarenal AAAs are asymptomatic when first detected and often incidentally discovered on unrelated imaging.\nSymptoms - Some patients may report symptoms such as abdominal, flank or back pain from pressure on adjacent somatic sensory nerves or overlying peritoneum. Tenderness by itself is not a reliable indicator of impending rupture. Other symptoms include thrombosis and distal embolization.\n\n\n10.2.1 Imaging\n\nUltrasound, when feasible, is the preferred imaging modality for aneurysm screening and surveillance.\n\nThe Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) recommends a one-time ultrasound screening in men and women ages 65 to 75 years with either a history of smoking or a family history of AAA, as well as men and women over the age of 75 with a smoking history in otherwise good health who have not previously undergone screening. (Chaikof, Dalman, Eskandari, Jackson, Lee, Mansour, Mastracci, Mell, Murad, Nguyen, Oderich, et al. 2018)\nFor more technical details on duplex screening see Section 20.6.1.\n\n\n\nRecommended Intervals for AAA Surveillance(Thompson et al. 2013; Chaikof, Dalman, Eskandari, Jackson, Lee, Mansour, Mastracci, Mell, Murad, Nguyen, Oderich, et al. 2018)\n\n\nSize on Imaging\nSurveillance Interval\n\n\n\n\n2.5 – 2.9 cm\n10 years\n\n\n3 - 3.9 cm\n3 years\n\n\n4 - 4.9 cm\n1 year\n\n\n5 - 5.4cm\n6 months\n\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that these screening guidelines are Level 2, Grade C evidence from the SVS.\nTraditionally, once duplex reveals an aneurysm 5cm in size, an initial CTA is performed and patients are followed with additional CT scans to assist with operative planning.\nCT angiograms are helpful in operative planning and determining candidacy for EVAR. You can assess the relationship of the aneurysm to the renal arteries, assess the access vessels, and measure seal zones\n\nThe maximum aneurysm diameter derived from the CTA should be based on outer wall to outer wall measurement perpendicular to the path of the aorta (the center-line of the aneurysm).\n\nMRA is recommended for patients with renal insufficiency who cannot tolerate iodinated contrast."

    "text": "10.3 Management\nWhat are the indications for repair? (Moore, Lawrence, and Oderich 2019)\n\nThe current recommendation to repair a fusiform aneurysm is 5.5cm for men (Level 1, Grade A evidence), 5.0cm for women as they have a higher risk for rupture, and rapid growth (>5mm over 6 months). (Chaikof, Dalman, Eskandari, Jackson, Lee, Mansour, Mastracci, Mell, Murad, Nguyen, Oderich, et al. 2018)\nFor saccular aneurysms, the SVS practice guidelines recommend elective repair (Level 2, Grade C evidence). (Chaikof, Dalman, Eskandari, Jackson, Lee, Mansour, Mastracci, Mell, Murad, Nguyen, Oderich, et al. 2018)\n\nStudies show equivalent wall stress in saccular aneurysms at much smaller sizes when compared to fusiform aneurysms. This has led to the notion that they have a higher rupture risk at smaller sizes.\nA study published in Annals of Vascular Surgery in 2016 showed a significant portion of ruptures <55mm in size were saccular in nature. (Kristmundsson et al. 2016)\n\nSpecific size guidelines for repair are currently lacking because of their infrequent presentation.\n\n\n\nWhat are the options for repair, and how do you choose? (Moore, Lawrence, and Oderich 2019; Fairman 2019)\n\nTwo options: open repair and endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR).\n\nWhen attempting to decide between the two, one must consider the patient’s perioperative risk as well as the patient’s anatomy, which will be reviewed further here.\n\nWhen reviewing the patient’s risk for surgery, there are many tools to assist, which are outlined in the Society for Vascular Surgery’s practice guidelines.\nThe VSGNE or Vascular Study Group of New England developed a risk prediction model for mortality which can assist in your decision making. This is endorsed by both SVS and the Vascular Quality Initiative.(Chaikof, Dalman, Eskandari, Jackson, Lee, Mansour, Mastracci, Mell, Murad, Nguyen, and al. 2018; Eslami et al. 2015)\n\nThis risk model looks at open vs endovascular repair and further delineates infrarenal vs suprarenal clamps\nIt includes aneurysm sizes with 6.5cm as the cut off.\nIt includes age above or below 75yo.\nGender and comorbidities are included like heart disease, cerebrovascular disease and COPD.\nAn important risk factor is also renal function which is delineated by creatinine at 1.5-2 or >2.\nEach of these risk factors is assigned a point grading.\nThese points are added together and they place the patient on a spectrum of mortality risk. Depending on the amount of points accumulated, the risk is divided into low, medium, high or prohibitively high-risk groups\nThis is something that can help both the patient and physician in deciding on surgery and how to proceed.\n\nRecent studies have shown that decreased aerobic fitness and high frailty score predicted increased morbidity and mortality after open aneurysm repair.\nHigh-risk patients are defined by the following in the SVS guidelines:\n\nUnstable angina or angina at rest\nCongestive heart failure with EF < 25-30%\nSerum creatinine level > 3 mg/dL\nPulmonary disease manifested by room air PaO2 < 50 mmHg, elevated PCO2, or both.\n\nTo help delineate a patient’s risk, a preoperative workup is necessary. The SVS practice guidelines recommend the following: (Chaikof, Dalman, Eskandari, Jackson, Lee, Mansour, Mastracci, Mell, Murad, Nguyen, Oderich, et al. 2018)\n\nDetermine if the patient has an active cardiovascular condition. Coronary artery disease is responsible for at least 50% to 60% of perioperative and late deaths after operations on the abdominal aorta, therefore, it is important for patients to undergo cardiac evaluation prior to surgery.\n\nUnstable angina, decompensated heart failure, severe valvular disease, significant arrhythmia -> Cardiology consultation (Level 1, Grade B)\nSignificant clinical risk factors such as coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, stroke, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease -> Stress test (Level 2, Grade B)\nWorsening dyspnea -> Echocardiogram (Level 1, Grade A)\nAll patients undergoing EVAR or open repair require EKG\nIn patients capable of moderate physical activities, such as climbing two flights of stairs or running a short distance (MET >= 4), there is no benefit in further testing.\nIf coronary intervention is required, this takes precedence over aneurysm repair.\n\nHistory of COPD\n\nPulmonary function test with ABG (Level 2, Grade C)\nSmoking cessation for at least 2 weeks prior (Level 1, Grade C)\nPulmonary bronchodilators at least 2 weeks before aneurysm repair (Level 2, Grade C)\n\n\nIn patients who are deemed high risk, EVAR is the most attractive option in anatomically suitable patients\nMorbidity and mortality rates are lower for EVAR than open repair in the short term. This is illustrated in multiple studies.\n\nThe EVAR-1 trial, a randomized prospective UK study including 1082 patients, compared EVAR with open AAA repair in patients who were fit enough to undergo open surgical repair from 1999-2003. The 30-day mortality rate was reduced in the EVAR group (1.7% vs 4.7%), although secondary interventions were more common in the EVAR group (9.8% vs. 5.8%). (R. Greenhalgh 2004)\nThe DREAM trial, a multicenter randomized trial from 2000-2003, compared EVAR vs Open repair in 345 patients with a reduction in operative mortality (4.7% vs 9.8%) with the majority of complications accounted for by pulmonary issues. (Prinssen, Cuypers, and Buskens 2004)\n\nThis early survival benefit with EVAR over open repair disappears by the third postoperative year.\n\nThe Open vs Endovascular Repair (OVER) trial included 881 patients from 42 VA centers randomized to either EVAR or open repair. This demonstrated that perioperative mortality was improved in the EVAR group (0.5% vs 3.0%), yet no statistically significant difference was seen in mortality at 2 years (7.0% vs 9.8%). (Lederle et al. 2019)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake a Listen\n\n\n\nCheck out our episode with Dr. Julie Freischlag where we discuss her involvement with the OVER trial.\n\n\n\nLate mortality seems to be higher in EVAR due to ruptures from endoleaks that do not occur in open repair. (Rajendran and May 2017)\n\nReviewing the anatomic criteria for traditional infrarenal EVAR may rule out EVAR as an option in some patients. These criteria vary slightly depending on the particular device being used.\n\nNeck\n\nA neck length of at least 10-15mm from the renal arteries to the aneurysm start with a diameter of 18-32mm.\nIt is important that the neck is relatively free of thrombus or calcification to decrease the risk of endoleaks.\nInfrarenal necks 4-15mm would require fenestrated endovascular repair. The only FDA approved device for fenestrated repairs is the Cook Z-Fen device.(Oderich et al. 2014)\n\nZ-fen requires diameter 19-31mm, angle <45deg angle to long axis of aneurysm, ipsilateral iliac fixation >30mm and 9-21mm in diam, contralateral iliac >30mm and 7-21mm diam. Multiple or early branching renal arteries can limit this reapir as well. (Oderich, Correa, and Mendes 2014)\nParallel grafts for short necks (i.e. snorkel or chimney) require 20mm seal for good outcomes. (Donas et al. 2015)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake a Look\n\n\n\nCheck out our “How I Do It” episode where Dr. Wes Jones and Murray Shames review their technique for performing a Zfen endovascular aortic anuerysm repair. This technique is beyond the scope of this review.\n\n\n\nAngulation\n\nNeck angulation should be < 60 degrees for current devices\n\nAccess vessels\n\nAccess vessels must be adequate for delivery of the device depending on the sheath size required (6-8mm)\n\nAortic bifurcation\n\nThe aortic bifurcation must be >20mm in size to accommodate the graft opening to full caliber\n\nIliac landing zone\n\nAdequate seal zone in the distal common iliac arteries of 10-15mm in length and diameter of 7.5-25mm.\nIf covering the hypogastric arteries is necessary unilaterally to obtain a seal, you can embolize the hypogastric artery (to prevent retrograde flow) and extend the graft into the external iliac artery.\nIf this is an issue bilaterally, an iliac branch device can assist in maintaining perfusion into the hypogastric arteries.\n\n\nSpecial considerations\n\nAortocaval fistula - sometimes aneurysms can be complicated by fistula with the IVC. This can occur with primary fistula, rupture and after repair. This is rare, 1% in elective AAA and 6% in rupture.(Brightwell, Pegna, and Boyne 2013; Schmidt et al. 1994) High risk of persistent endoleak due to ongoing flow into IVC. Open repair often best.(Orion, Beaulieu, and Black 2016)\n\n\n10.3.1 EVAR\nCan you briefly go over the steps of an EVAR? (Moore, Lawrence, and Oderich 2019)\nEVAR now accounts for approximately 70-80% of elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repairs and 65% of iliac aneurysm repairs in the United States and many other countries.\n\nPerformed in the operating room or IR suite with a fixed or portable C-arm\nAnesthesia\n\nRegional block, local anesthesia or general anesthesia depending on surgeon preference and patient risk\n\nGroin access and short sheath placement\n\nPercutaneous - Closure devices are introduced prior to inserting the large sheaths containing the stent-grafts\nCut-down\n\nPigtail catheter is used to perform an aortogram of the abdominal aorta and iliac arteries\nThe renal artery orifices are marked. If there is any concern about good visualization, IVUS (intravascular ultrasound) can be used to assist.\nSystemic heparin is given\nBilateral femoral sheaths are exchanged over a stiff wire for the necessary sheaths required for the device size chosen.\n\nMain trunk and ipsilateral limb sheath on one side\nContralateral limb sheath on the other side\n\nThe main body is positioned in the proximal neck and a repeat angiogram is commonly performed to confirm the positioning of the device at the desired level just below the lowest renal artery. It is best to position the main body so that the gate is directed at the simplest angle to cannulate.\nThe main body is deployed to the point where the gate is opened\nContralateral limb gate cannulation is performed using a wire and directional catheter.\nOnce in the gate, a pigtail catheter is formed within the main body and must be able to spin freely 360 degrees to confirm placement within the endograft. There are multiple techniques to confirm that the wire is in the endograft, but this MUST be confirmed before proceeding to deploy the contralateral limb.\nThe contralateral limb is introduced and deployed taking care to preserve flow to the internal iliac artery.\nThe remainder of the main body is deployed and iliac extensions deployed if required.\nThe stent graft is ballooned at the neck, within the gate, at the bifurcation, and distal iliac seal zones.\nAn aortogram, usually multiple in different views, is performed to exclude any endoleaks.\nThe sheaths are removed, and the groin sites are closed using Perclose devices if performed percutaneously, or primary repair if open cutdown performed.\nCheck pedal signals at the end of the case to ensure no thromboembolic events or femoral artery access injuries have occurred. If there is concern, an ultrasound duplex can be performed intraoperatively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake a Listen\n\n\n\nCheck out our episode where we review the basics of the EVAR procedure in more detail.\n\n\nYou mentioned endoleaks, can you discuss the complications specific to EVAR and the management? (Moore, Lawrence, and Oderich 2019)\n\n15 year follow up from EVAR-1 shows inferior late survival and higher re-intervention in EVAR patients when compared with open repair. (Patel et al. 2016)\nMany of the cardiopulmonary complications inherent with open repair do not occur with EVAR as there is no aortic cross clamping.\n\nIn a study from Mayo clinic evaluating elective infrarenal AAA repairs from 1999 to 2001, Elkouri et al found that cardiac and pulmonary morbidity after EVAR was drastically reduced compared to open repair (11% vs 22% and 3% vs 16%, respectively). (Elkouri et al. 2004)\n\nRisk of ischemic colitis remains as the IMA is covered with EVAR. It is lower than with open repair but remains 1-2%.\nRenal insufficiency may occur secondary to contrast administration in a patient with underlying chronic kidney disease. Thromboembolic events may occur from thrombus-laden aortic necks with wire and device manipulation to the renal arteries as well.\nIliac limb occlusion - can occur within hours of EVAR (3-5%). Risk factors included iliac artery tortuosity, calcified plaque burden or occlusive disease, external iliac artery dissection(Vacirca et al. 2019), inadequate outflow due to access site complication. Post operative CFA duplex will show dampened waveforms.(R. M. Greenhalgh et al. 2010; Taudorf et al. 2014)\nEmergent conversion from EVAR to open are associated with significant increase in morbidity and mortality. Risk factors include aneurysm diameter, young age, female gender and nonwhite race.(Ultee et al. 2016a)\n\n\n10.3.1.1 Endoleak\nDefined as persistent blood flow within the aneurysm sac following EVAR.\n\nType I\n\nA leak at the graft ends secondary to inadequate seal proximally (1a) or distally (1b)\nIf identified intraoperatively, Type I endoleaks require attention with further balloon angioplasty, proximal or distal extension, or endoanchors.\n\nUse of endoanchors in thrombus and calcium-laden aorta is not recommended.(Jordan et al. 2014) Outcomes are similar with or without suprarenal fixation.\n\nIf seen in follow up surveillance, intervention is necessary.\n\nType II\n\nSac filling secondary to retrograde filling via a branch vessel off of the aneurysm sac such as a lumbar artery or the IMA\nIf identified intraoperatively, this typically does not need to be addressed in the OR. Typically, type II endoleaks spontaneously thrombose and therefore can be observed.\nIt is common to continue monitoring even if there is persistent flow as long as there is no aneurysm sac growth. Type II endoleaks persist in 5-25% of patients. Risk factors for persistent endoleak include anticoagulation(Bobadilla et al. 2010), patency/number/diameter of IMA/lumbar arteries(Ward et al. 2014), hypogastric coil embolization, distal graft extension, absence of COPD, age >80yrs, and graft type. Risk of rupture is 1.5-3%.(Lo and Schermerhorn 2016b; Abularrage et al. 2010; Timaran et al. 2004; Shalaby et al. 2016; Sarac et al. 2012; Jones et al. 2007)\nIf the leak persists for > 6 months with sac enlargement >5mm, intervention is recommended. Several techniques exist to eliminate type II endoleaks, most frequently embolization. After multiple attempts at repair and if continued sac growth with impending Type I leak, then consider open conversion.(Kelso et al. 2009; Mohapatra et al. 2019)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake a Listen\n\n\n\nCheck out our conversation with Drs Gregorio Sicard and Frank Caputo where we discuss management of endograft failures and some techniques for open conversion that are a little beyond the details of this review.\n\n\n\nType III\n\nSeparation of graft components. Treated by relining the EVAR graft.\nUsually identified in follow-up surveillance and necessitates intervention.\n\nType IV\n\nSecondary to a porous graft which typically does not occur any longer as endograft material and devices have improved. If seen, no intervention is needed at the time, and they usually thrombose on their own.\n\nType V\n\nIncreasing aneurysm sac size with no identifiable endoleak. Commonly referred to as endotension.\nUsually necessitates graft explantation and open repair or re-lining of the graft.\n\n\n\n\n\n10.3.2 Open Repair\nNow we can move onto open repair. Describe an open infrarenal aneurysm repair. (Moore, Lawrence, and Oderich 2019; Gary G Wind and R. James Valentine 2013)\nAfter thorough preoperative evaluation and clearance, the patient is taken back to the operating room. An epidural may be placed preoperatively depending on institutional preference. The patient is intubated, and arterial and central venous catheters are placed. The abdomen is prepped from chest to bilateral thighs.\nA cell-saver should be available to optimize resuscitation during the procedure due to expected large amounts of blood loss. Balanced resuscitation to prevent coagulopathy is important with significant blood loss.\nExposure\n\nTrans-peritoneal or retro-peritoneal. First we will describe the most common approach: trans-peritoneal.\n\nSurgical steps\n\nMid-line laparotomy, transverse or chevron-style incision\nA retractor system such as an Omni, Bookwalter or Balfour retractor is used to assist in exposure depending on physician preference.\nThe transverse colon is retracted cephalad, and the small bowel is retracted to the patient’s right to expose the aorta. The duodenum is mobilized and the ligament of Treitz is divided. The posterior peritoneum is opened along the anterior wall of the aorta.\nThe aneurysm sac is now in view and careful dissection proximally for clamp site is achieved. Identification of the left renal vein crossing the aorta is key and can be divided if necessary.\nIdentification of the renal arteries proximally is required if there is a plan for suprarenal clamping.\nIsolate bilateral common iliac arteries for distal clamp site. Use caution when dissecting the fibro-areolar tissue overlying the left common iliac artery as it contains nerves that control sexual function. Damage can result in retrograde ejaculation.\n\nYou can avoid nerve injury with mobilization of the sigmoid colon medially and identifying the iliac bifurcation distally, thus avoiding transecting the tissue overlying the left common iliac artery.\nIf the iliac arteries are severely calcified and pose risk for injury with clamping, intraluminal balloon catheters can be inserted for distal control instead.\nAlso, you must be cognizant of the location of the ureters crossing over the iliac bifurcation to prevent injury.\n\nAfter proximal and distal clamp sites have been identified, systemic heparin is administered by anesthesia.\nClamp the distal vessels first to prevent distal embolization.\nOpen the aneurysm sac in a longitudinal fashion toward the patient’s right to avoid the IMA and clear the sac of thrombus. Extend proximally to normal aorta and then t off the incision on the aortic wall.\n\nSome physicians prefer to transect the aortic wall as opposed to leaving the posterior wall intact for the anastomosis.\n\nLumbar arteries on the posterior wall are ligated using figure-of-eight sutures.\n\nBack-bleeding lumbar vessels can be the source of significant blood loss.\n\nGraft\n\nA tube graft or bifurcated graft depending on the patient’s anatomy and aortic diameter is chosen. Dacron or PTFE grafts are most common, and the choice depends on physician preference. This is anastomosed proximally in a continuous fashion.\nOnce complete, the graft is flushed forward to flush out any thrombus. The graft is then clamped and the aortic clamp removed to test the anastomosis. Repair if needed.\nThe distal anastomosis is completed to the aorta or bilateral iliac arteries depending on extent of the aneurysm.\nThe graft is flushed forward prior to completion to remove any thrombus within the graft. The anastomosis is completed and clamps removed.\n\nHypotension may occur at this point from re-perfusion of the lower extremities and pelvis. Anesthesia should be notified that unclamping will occur soon prior to completion of the distal anastomosis to allow for fluid resuscitation in preparation.\n\nThe graft can be slowly unclamped or partially clamped to assist with blood pressure management during this time. You can also place manual pressure on the iliac arteries or femoral arteries to slowly release flow and avoid significant hypotension.\n\nNext, the IMA must be addressed. The IMA orifice is identified within the aneurysm sac.\n\nChronically occluded or pulsatile back bleeding -> ligate.\nAnything between occlusion and strong pulsatile back bleeding requires further evaluation. This should be performed at the end of the case after the internal iliacs have been reperfused. Methods to measure perfusion:\n\nPlace vessel loops or micro bulldog on IMA and assess the sigmoid colon. If there is a poor doppler signal on the antimesenteric border of the sigmoid colon, the IMA should be reimplanted.\nInsert blunt-tip needle through the IMA orifice and pull vessel loop around needle to secure and connect to a transducer. Pressure less than 35 mmHg requires reimplantation. (Hoballah 2021)\n\nThe Carrel patch technique involves excising a circular button of the aortic wall around the IMA and anastomosing it to the graft wall.\nNewer studies have shown that IMA reimplantation does not eliminate the risk of ischemic colitis after open AAA repair. In a study out of George Washington University in DC published in JVS in 2019, there was still significant risk of ischemic colitis rates with IMA reimplantation. (K. B. Lee et al. 2019)\n\nUsing NSQIP data collected prospectively and studied retrospectively\nOut of 2397 patients undergoing AAA from 2012-2015, 135 patients (5.6%) had ischemic colitis.\n672 patients were evaluated further after exclusion criteria applied (suprarenal clamp, emergent or ruptured, occluded mesenteric vessels)\nOf these, 637 patients had IMA ligation, 35 had IMA reimplantation\nReimplantation was associated with - More frequent return to the OR (20% vs 7.2%), Higher rates of wound complications (17.1% vs 3%), Higher rates of ischemic colitis (8.6% vs 2.4%)\n\nDifficult to interpret impact of revascularization of IMA on ischemic colitis rates, due to selection bias, but should be noted that patients who require revascularization still may experience colon ischemia.\n\nTo finish, the aneurysm sac is then closed over the graft to protect the viscera, and the retro-peritoneum is reapproximated. Occasionally, a vascularized omental pedicle flap may be used to separate the graft from the duodenum to prevent an aorto-enteric fistula if the peritoneum cannot be closed securely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake a Look\n\n\n\nCheck out our “How I Do It” episode where Dr. Ashlee Vinyard and Dr. John Eidt review their technique for performing a open AAA repair.\n\n\nSteps for the retro-peritoneal approach:\n\nPositioned semi-lateral with the left side up with bilateral groins exposed for femoral artery access. This is done in a lazy lateral position where the patients upper body is near complete lateral but the hips are rotated to the patient’s left in attempt to keep both groins in the field in case they need to be accessed.\nAn oblique incision extends from the left 11th intercostal space or tip of the 12th rib to the edge of the rectus abdominus muscle, through the external and internal oblique muscles, transversalis fascia until you are just superficial to the peritoneum. Using blunt finger dissection, the peritoneum is dissected from the abdominal wall posteriorly over the psoas muscle until the aorta is reached.\n\nBenefits include less postoperative ileus, less intraoperative hypothermia, lower IV fluid requirements, and less post-op respiratory compromise.\nA disadvantage is the difficulty addressing the right iliac artery from this approach. Patients can also develop denervation of the lateral abdominal wall and develop a bulge there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake a Listen\n\n\n\nCheck out our Origin Stories episode reviewing the history of aortic aneurysm repair.\n\n\n\n10.3.2.1 Complications\nWhat are some of the complications with open aortic aneurysm repair? (Moore, Lawrence, and Oderich 2019)\n\nRecent studies have demonstrated equivalent outcomes in younger healthy patients undergoing endovascular and open repair. (Liang et al. 2018)\nMyocardial dysfunction which is usually secondary to cardiac ischemia or hemorrhage.\n\nAcute conditions associated with poor post-operative cardiac outcomes include recent MI (30d), unstable angina, decompensated heart failure, high-grade arrhythmias, severe valvular disease.(Devereaux and Sessler 2015; Fleisher et al. 2014; Kristensen et al. 2014; Tashiro et al. 2014)\n\nAbdominal compartment syndrome secondary to coagulopathic bleeding postoperatively or third spacing of fluids can cause abdominal compartment syndrome requiring emergent laparotomy.(Cheatham et al. 2007; Mehta et al. 2005; Rasmussen and Hallett 1997)\n\nSigns include unexplained oliguria, difficulty maintaining adequate ventilation–elevated peak inspiratory pressure, and hypotension with significant abdominal distension is concerning for abdominal compartment syndrome. A sustained bladder pressure > 25 mmHg with associated organ dysfunction (elevated peak airway pressures, new onset acute renal failure) is indicative of abdominal compartment syndrome.\nAbdominal compartment syndrome can still occur after EVAR during an aortic rupture in up to 10-20% of patients, therefore, one must keep a heightened suspicion for this in the post-operative period.(Veith et al. 2009)\nIt is important to note that a patient with a soft abdominal exam can still have abdominal compartment syndrome particularly with an enlarged body habitus.\nLaparotomy may initially worsen hypotension and hemodynamic instability due to reperfusion injury.\n\nRenal failure can occur due to suprarenal aortic clamping, atheromatous embolization or hypotension causing acute tubular necrosis (ATN).\n\nA suprarenal clamp time of less then 30 minutes is ideal to reduce the risk of renal failure.\n\nPostoperative ileus is common. Duodenal obstruction from dissection of the ligament of Treitz can mimic a gastric outlet obstruction.\nIschemic colitis of the left colon and rectum is the most serious gastrointestinal complication.(Moghadamyeghaneh et al. 2016)\n\nIncidence ranges from 0.2 - 10%, 3-4x more common after operations for occlusive disease than aneurysmal disease.\nIt is important to study the collateral pathways on the preoperative CT scan and the patient’s history to assist in surgical decisions regarding IMA reimplantation including:\n\nStenosis/occlusion of the SMA\nPrevious colectomy\nIMA or Hypogastric artery occlusion\n\nEarliest manifestation is postoperative diarrhea, especially bloody diarrhea.\nSigmoidoscopy is needed for diagnosis.\n\nMild colon ischemia with patchy mucosal involvement should be treated with bowel rest, fluid resuscitation and antibiotics. Transmural necrosis requires emergent operation with colon resection. Patients can be left in discontinuity or an end colostomy performed depending on stability.\nThe mortality rate with colon ischemia after aneurysm surgery is about 25% but reaches over 50% if bowel resection is required.(Brewster et al. 1991) This is a very heavily tested topic for both general surgery and vascular surgery boards.\n\n\nDistal ischemia from embolization downstream can lodge in larger vessels or cause microembolization, colloquially known as “trash foot”.\nInfection is rare but can be associated with graft-enteric fistula which is another highly tested topic.(Fatima et al. 2013; Oderich et al. 2011; Smeds et al. 2016)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake a Listen\n\n\n\nCheck out our conversation with Miss Rachel Bell where we discuss management of infected aortic grafts and mycotic aneurysms that is a little beyond the scope of this review.\n\n\n\n\n10.3.2.2 Postoperative Surveillance\nWhat is the post-operative surveillance required for open and endovascular approach, and how do they differ? (Moore, Lawrence, and Oderich 2019)\n\nThat is a great question because it highlights why open repair has continued to be so important, especially for young, healthy patients.\nPost-operative surveillance is necessary in the immediate post-operative period for open repair to evaluate incisions. Follow-up is only needed every 5-10 years, unless the patient becomes symptomatic.\n\nPerianastomotic degeneration occurs in 0.5-10% of cases. Can be diagnosed with CT scan or ultrasound.(Curl et al. 1992)\n\nIn contrast, EVAR patients require a strict postoperative surveillance regimen to allow for detection of endoleaks, aneurysm sac expansion, stent fracture, limb kinking and material fatigue.\n\nCT scans at 1-, 6- and 12-month intervals initially then annually are recommended which raises concerns related to cost, cumulative radiation exposure, and contrast administration.\nSome physicians may elect to use ultrasound for surveillance with CTA prompted if an endoleak is identified or the sac is enlarged, particularly in patients with stable aneurysms.\nThe long-term follow-up is often inconsistent and a study of 19,962 Medicare beneficiaries undergoing EVAR from 2001 to 2008 showed that 50% of patients were lost to annual imaging follow-up at 5 years after surgery.(Schanzer et al. 2015)\n\nSome patients will elect for open repair to avoid frequent surveillance if they are a candidate for both, while other patients will select endovascular management to avoid the short-term effects like longer hospitalizations, post-operative pain, and longer recovery time to baseline functioning in open surgery.\n\n\n\n\n10.3.3 Ruptured Aneurysms\nAlthough elective repair is important, can you touch on the management of a ruptured AAA (RAAA) as our last topic of the session? (Moore, Lawrence, and Oderich 2019; Lindsay 2019b)\nRuptured AAAs have declined secondary to improved medical management, decreased rates of smoking and superior diagnostic imaging and surveillance.\nTraditionally, it has been taught that 50% of ruptured AAAs die in the field and of those remaining, 50% will die in the hospital. With time, the in-hospital mortality rate has decreased.\n\nIn one study out of Finland, of 712 patients with ruptured AAAs from 2003-2013, 52% died prior to arrival to the hospital. Of those that were offered surgery, 67% of patients were alive at 30 days indicating a mortality rate of 33%. (M. T. Laine et al. 2016)\n\nDiagnostic triad on presentation:\n\nPain, syncope and known or palpable AAA.\n\nWhen a ruptured AAA is suspected or diagnosed, permissive hypotension is key in the initial management before surgery.\n\nAllowing systolic arterial pressures of 50-70 mmHg as long as the patient is mentating appropriately.\nLimits internal bleeding which further limits loss of platelets and clotting factors.\n\nInitial management involves many considerations like patient stability, patient’s anatomy and the surgeon’s experience with either open or endovascular repair.\nDue to the developments of endovascular techniques, it is ideal to have a CTA prior to the operating room to determine if the patient is a candidate for an EVAR.\nThere are two options for expedient aortic control in an unstable patient with a ruptured aneurysm.\n\nOpen supraceliac aortic clamping\n\nAchieved by retracting the stomach caudally, entering and dividing a portion of the gastrohepatic ligament, reaching under and medial to the caudate lobe, dividing the pars flaccida, and identifying the spine. The aorta lies to the patient’s left of the spine and is bluntly dissected anteriorly and laterally for aortic clamp placement.\nAnother method of supraceliac exposure and control is to mobilize and reflect the left lobe of the liver, sweep the esophagus to the patient’s left, divide the right crus of the diaphragm and bluntly dissect both sides of the aorta then apply the clamp.\nA nasogastric tube can help identify the esophagus when placing this clamp to ensure the esophagus has been swept to the patient’s left and protected.\nThe clamp should be moved down to the desired position for repair (supra or infrarenal depending on anatomy of the aneurysm neck) to decrease ischemia time to visceral vessels as soon as possible.\n\nPercutaneous occlusive aortic balloon\n\nGain percutaneous access and place an occlusive aortic balloon for stabilization in the distal thoracic aorta. This will require a long support sheath, usually 12fr in size, to prevent distal migration of the occlusive balloon.\n\n\nEVAR has been used increasingly to treat ruptured AAAs and offers many theoretical advantages over open repair.\n\nLess invasive, eliminates risk of damage to periaortic and abdominal structures, decreases bleeding from surgical dissection, minimizes hypothermia and third space losses, and lessens the requirement for deep anesthesia.\nEVAR has been deemed superior to open repair for the treatment of RAAA in many studies.\n\nIn a study out of UVA published in JVS in August 2020, they looked at ruptures in the VQI database from 2003-2018. This resulted in 724 pairs of open and endovascular pairs after propensity matching. (Wang et al. 2020)\n\nThere was a clear advantage of endovascular compared to open repair in patient’s with suitable anatomy.\nLength of stay was decreased with 5 vs 10 days in open. 30 day mortality was much lower at 18% vs 32%. Major adverse events like MI, Renal failure, leg ischemia, mesenteric ischemia, respiratory complications were much lower in the EVAR group at 35% vs 68% in the open group.\nAll cause 1 year survival was much higher with EVAR at 73% vs 59% in the open group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake a Listen\n\n\n\nCheck out our conversation with Professor Janet Powell where we discuss her landmark IMPROVE trial comparing open and endovascular management of ruptured aortic aneurysms.\n\n\n\nDespite improved RAAA results with EVAR, conversion from EVAR to open AAA repair appears to have the most unfavorable outcomes in terms of mortality.\n\nConversions can be early or late and are due to access-related problems, errors in endograft deployment, graft migration, persistent endoleak, graft thrombosis, or infection.\nIn a study evaluating 32,164 patients from NSQIP with 300 conversions (7,188 standard open repairs and 24,676 EVARs), conversion to open repair was associated with a significantly higher 30-day mortality than standard open repair (10% vs 4.2%) and EVAR (10% vs 1.7%). In addition, conversion patients compared to standard open patients were more likely to undergo new dialysis (6.0% vs. 3.5%), cardiopulmonary resuscitation (5.3% vs. 1.9%), postoperative blood transfusion (42.3% vs. 31.6%), and have a myocardial infarction (5.0% vs. 2.2%). (Ultee et al. 2016b)\nA more recent systematic review and meta-analysis found the elective late open conversion has comparable outcomes to primary open aneurysm repair. 36% are able to complete with infrarenal clamp alone. Highest complication rate in urgent setting (10x higher mortality). (Goudeketting et al. 2019)"

Laine et al. 2017)\nTreatment options include\n\nOpen repair\n\nIf open repair involves aneurysm or occlusive disease of internal iliac arteries, should attempt to revascularize at least one IIA via a jump graft.(Krupski et al. 1998; Huang et al. 2008)\n\nIliac branched device to preserve hypogastric. Minimum size requirements include:\n\nCIA 17mm in diameter\nEIA 6.5-25mm in diameter, 10mm seal zone\nIIA 6.5-13.5mm in diameter, 10mm seal zone(Schneider et al. 2017)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake a Look\n\n\n\nCheck out our “How I Do It” episode where Dr. Lily Johnston and Dr. Gustavo Oderich review their technique for performing an iliac branch device repair with is a little beyond the scope of this review.\n\n\n\nExtension of EVAR into external iliac and coil of internal iliac artery\n\nIf internal iliac arteries also aneurysmal, ensure that outflow vessels are all coiled. Posterior branch gives rise to the superior gluteal artery, which is high risk for retrograde filling.(Ryer et al. 2012)\nCoil embolization can result in ipsilateral buttock claudication in 12-22% of patients. Treatment is with medical therapy and walking regimen, resolution usually occurs at 6 months.(Papazoglou et al. 2012; Stokmans et al. 2013)\nIf the IMA is chronically occluded, then coverage of the IIA may compromise colonic blood flow and increase risk of ischemia.(Angiletta et al. 2011; Karch et al. 2000)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbularrage, Christopher J., Robert S.

    "text": "Authors: Matt Chia, MD and Nick Mouawad, MD\nMesenteric vascular disease can be broken down into three disease states that we’ll cover today. There’s the arterial disease, which is clearly separated into acute mesenteric ischemia and chronic mesenteric ischemia. Then there is venous disease, which we’ll touch on briefly. There are also a handful of somewhat related diseases that we’ll also sprinkle into these discussions, like median arcuate ligament syndrome and SMA syndrome, but that’s overall where we’re headed.\nMesenteric collatorals are important for protecting against mesenteric ischemia. The gastroduodenal and pacreaticoduodenal arteries connect the celiac and SMA. The meandering artery (Arc of Riolan) and marginal artery of Drummond connect IMA and SMA. Hemorrhoidal branches connect internal iliacs and IMA. (Chandra and Quinones-Baldrich 2010; van Gulik and Schoots 2005)"

    "section": "11.1 Acute Mesenteric Ischemia",
    "text": "11.1 Acute Mesenteric Ischemia\n\n11.1.1 Presentation and Evaluation\nCan you tell me about the classic presentation and approach to patients presenting with acute mesenteric ischemia?\nThese patients present with the sudden onset of abdominal pain. Nausea, vomiting, distention, and diarrhea (possibly bloody, described as “sudden and forceful evacuation”) are the common symptoms. Pain out of proportion is the classic buzzword, and can be hidden on multiple choice tests with a pain score of 10/10 with only mild abdominal tenderness on physical exam.\nEtiology most often from acute embolism (40-50%), which is often secondary to cardiac source (atrial fibrillation or recent MI).(Wyers, Mark C and Martin 2019)\nVitals typically normal, possible tachycardia.\nLab evaluation typically unremarkable. Leukocytosis, hemoconcentration, and acidosis (high anion gap) all are frequently found, but the absence of these definitely does not rule out acute mesenteric ischemia.\nD-dimer has been proposed as a reasonable rule-out test for acute mesenteric ischemia.\nHow about radiology studies?\nPlain film:\nFrequently normal, may show ileus in the early stages. In late stage acute mesenteric ischemia, findings on plain film can include bowel wall edema (thumbprinting) or pneumatosis.\nCT angio:\nProbably represents the most common diagnostic modality to diagnose acute mesenteric ischemia. CTA has the advantages of speed, availability, and noninvasiveness when compared to conventional angiography, and also allows for some assessment of the degree of bowel involvement. \nPreferentially, a “negative” oral contrast agent would help prevent oral contrast from causing artifact or obscuring evaluation of the vessels, although the availability of these agents may limit their use.\nHow about mesenteric duplex (vascular lab studies)?\nMesenteric duplex has the advantage of being able to see the velocity of flow across a stenosis, giving you a good method of quantifying the significance of a stenosis. However, bowel gas often limits the acoustic windows for visualizing the mesenteric arteries, and so we usually will have patients fast for several hours before a study. Also, duplex is more sensitive for proximal disease rather than distal mesenteric involvement. For these reasons, mesenteric duplex is considered the gold standard for evaluating chronic mesenteric ischemia, but has no real role in the evaluation of acute mesenteric ischemia. Can you imagine, having a tech mash a transducer into a patient with acute abdominal pain?! \n\n\n11.1.2 Management\nWhat’s your approach to the initial management of the patient?\n\nResuscitation. Fluids, fluids, fluids. These patients are really volume down, and are headed towards a profound distributive shock that will be worsened by your eventual plan for revascularization (think ischemia-reperfusion injury). Also look for electrolyte imbalances and correct those early.\nAntibiotics. These patients are not usually septic on initial presentation, but are at high-risk, so broad-spectrum antibiotics with gut coverage (Gram negative and anaerobes) are standard of care.\nHeparin. In the absence of a clinical contraindication, these patients should be systemically heparinized, with a bolus, as soon as the diagnosis is made. \n\nWhich blood vessel does acute mesenteric ischemia typically involve?\nThe SMA. This makes sense if you think of each mesenteric distribution. The celiac distribution has organs that have redundant blood supply (like liver and stomach). The IMA is frequently occluded in patients with AAA, but the patients are rarely ever symptomatic due to collateral flow. The hypogastrics (which ARE mesenteric vessels, especially in the situation of an occluded IMA) principally supply the rectum from a mesenteric standpoint.\nFor embolic pathology, the acute angle of the SMA seems to predispose it to capture emboli from above, but this is more theoretical than proven. The embolism is often lodged distal to middle colic vessel.(Wyers, Mark C and Martin 2019; Kazmers 1998)\nTell me about the two main pathologies, and how they would differ in terms of the anatomy and operative findings.\nSo the two most common etiologies of acute mesenteric ischemia are embolism and thrombosis. \nEmbolism is the more common, where preexisting thrombus (think atrial fibrillation, mural thrombus from thoracic aneurysm, etc.) or plaques from atherosclerotic disease break off and lodge in the SMA. The classic operative finding is that an embolism lodges just distal to the middle colic artery, where there is a significant caliber change in the SMA. This is distal to the first few jejunal branches off of the SMA, leading to the classic sparing of the proximal jejunum and transverse colon. In other words, the mid to distal jejunum and all of the ileum will be ischemic, but other areas of the SMA territory are spared. Atherosclerotic debris is typically smaller, and results in smaller, more patchy areas of ischemia.\nThrombosis occurs primarily as a plaque rupture of preexisting atherosclerotic disease, resulting in acute thrombosis at the site of the disease. Thus the patients will often present with an acute-on-chronic symptomatology, having classic symptoms of postprandial abdominal pain, food fear, and weight loss, but with a sudden onset of severe symptoms. This frequently allows for the development of mesenteric collaterals, which may make the onset of acute symptoms more insidious than for embolic pathology. In the majority of situations, the atherosclerotic disease is most severe right at the origin (consistent with what we know about shear stress and branch points in blood vessels). This means that when the plaque ruptures, the entirety of the SMA occludes, leading to ischemia of the entire territory, as opposed to the jejunal-sparing distribution seen in embolic disease.\nDescribe the operative steps to getting exposure of the supraceliac aorta (or the celiac artery).\n\nDivide triangular ligament to mobilize left lobe of liver\nDivide gastrohepatic ligament to enter the lesser sac \nRetract liver to right with a self-retaining retractor\nPush esophagus left (use NGT to assist with identification)\nDivide peritoneum overlying crura to identify celiac vessels\nTypically trace common hepatic artery backwards to identify celiac artery\n\nWatch out for the left gastric vein as it crosses the celiac artery as it drains the lesser curve of the stomach into the portal vein.\nAbout half of the time, the phrenic artery takes an origin from the celiac artery and must be controlled during exposure.\n\nTo expose the supraceliac aorta, divide the median arcuate ligament and separate the left and right crura from each other.\n\nSo through this kind of exposure, what mesenteric vessels do you get access to?\nYou can trace most of the proximal celiac distribution right at the origin, and through this exposure you get access to the origin of the SMA if you mobilize the superior border of the pancreas. The neck of the pancreas and the splenic vein cross the anterior of the SMA, obscuring the rest of the mid and distal SMA from the superior approach.\nHow about getting to the rest of the SMA?\nThere are a couple of places you can get exposure to the SMA. \nMost commonly you’ll hear it described at “root of the mesentery.” Specifically, lifting up the transverse colon will stretch out its mesentery (i.e. transverse mesocolon). At the bottom, or “root” of the transverse mesocolon, a transverse incision is made. If the middle colic artery is palpable in the mesocolon, the incision can be made around it, and you can trace the middle colic backwards to the SMA. Usually you’ll find the SMV first, and the SMA will be just to the left of it. Be sure to identify and preserve small jejunal branches during the dissection. If needed, careful dissection superiorly, going behind the inferior border of the pancreas can get a little more proximal exposure. Embolectomy through a transverse arteriotomy in the SMA is the best approach.(Wyers and Martin 2019; Kazmers 1998)\nAlternatively, you can get to the SMA from a lateral approach, specifically from the left side. Begin by dividing the ligament of Treitz and mobilizing the 4th portion of the duodenum. The SMA is found in the tissues just cephalad to the duodenum. You can also improve your proximal exposure if needed by retracting the inferior border of the pancreas cephalad to the level of the left renal vein.\nOther options include a retroperitoneal exposure, like you were preparing to treat a thoracoabdominal aneurysm. Additionally, the more distal SMA can just be identified in the small bowel mesentery.\nSo for the operative strategy for acute mesenteric ischemia, tell me about the general approach to the patient.\n\nResect frankly necrotic bowel and contain gross spillage. Once you revascularize the bowel, compromised-appearing bowel may improve and not need immediate resection. Thus the first step is only damage control, to remove anything completely unsalvageable that is making the patient sick, or anything causing gross contamination of the operative field. The key is you’re not doing anything definitive with the bowel as your first step.\nRevascularization. SMA embolectomy is the initial management of choice for embolic disease. Thrombotic disease, on the other hand, may be more challenging to treat by embolectomy alone, and frequently are treated with a bypass. (More to come on these procedures).\nRe-assess bowel viability. Clinical status permitting, 20-30 minutes should be taken to fully assess the results of the revascularization before proceeding with resection. Perfusion can be assessed by many methods, including clinically, by Doppler, pulse oximetry (a.k.a. photoplethysmography), fluorescein fluorescence, etc. The take home is to give the bowel enough time to be perfused before going ahead with resection.\nProceed with temporizing or definitive bowel repair. Resection, leaving in discontinuity, primary anastomosis, diversion, etc. All of these are options on the table, but the key here is that all of the previous steps occur before addressing the bowel. \nConsider second-look laparotomy. Many times, bowel may look questionable even after revascularization and thorough re-assessment. To preserve the most bowel length, it may be reasonable to leave borderline bowel alone at the index operation and do a “second look” to fully reassess the bowel, especially after the patient has benefited from aggressive resuscitation in the ICU.\n\nEndovascular approaches to acute mesenteric ischemia have been described but data is limited. Exploratory laparotomy and embolectomy should be preferred management.(Wyers and Martin 2019)\nLet’s talk a little about the steps for an SMA embolectomy.\nTypically, you’ll expose at the root of the transverse mesocolon. After obtaining proximal and distal control, an arteriotomy is made, and embolectomy can be performed by passing Fogarty catheters in both a retrograde and antegrade fashion. The arteriotomy can be made transversely for an embolectomy, and thus could be closed primarily. A longitudinal arteriotomy may be advisable if you have a high suspicion that you’ll need to do a bypass, and if not, may be closed with vein patch angioplasty (remember that the field is contaminated or dirty in many situations).\nSo if I’m gonna do a bypass, what are my options for conduit?\nYeah, so again, because the field is frequently contaminated or dirty, a good conduit is saphenous, followed by femoral vein. Thus every patient undergoing surgery for acute mesenteric ischemia should have both legs prepped out in the field. Prosthetic conduit has the advantages of being more resistant to kinking (externally reinforced), likely better patency than vein (although data are a little mixed), but in the situation of gross contamination may be less preferred than vein. Other less common options include cryo-preserved cadaveric homograft, or rifampin-soaked prosthetic.\nAnd what are some of my options for constructing a bypass?\nShort retrograde aorto-SMA bypass:\nThis bypass takes is origin off of the aorta just below the SMA, anastomosing typically end-side onto the SMA just below its origin in order to bypass ostial or very proximal disease. This is a relatively quick bypass, with only one field of dissection directly from the aorta below the SMA onto the proximal-mid SMA. The length of the bypass is very short, limiting concerns with kinking or twisting of the bypass. However, this may not always be feasible, as SMA disease often coexists with significant aortic disease. Additionally, the other bypasses described have better reported patency.\nLong retrograde R iliac-SMA bypass (“C-loop”):\nThis bypass originates from the right common iliac artery, which presents a number of distinct advantages over an aorto-mesenteric bypass. First, using the iliacs avoids the hemodynamic consequences of an aortic cross-clamp, which may be contraindicated depending on your patient’s medical condition. Second, you can avoid showering, causing dissection, or otherwise injuring your clamp sites if you have significant disease in the mesenteric segment of the aorta, which is common in patients with chronic mesenteric ischemia. The graft should be tunneled in a gentle C-loop towards the SMA to avoid kinking or twisting. The proximal anastomosis is performed end-side on the iliac artery, and the distal can be performed either end-end or end-side depending on the anatomy of the disease. Especially when using prosthetic in a contaminated field, you can consider taking an omental flap to wrap or cover the prosthetic.\nAntegrade supraceliac aorta-SMA bypass:\nThis bypass originates from the supraceliac aorta. If revascularization of both celiac and SMA is planned, a bifurcated graft can be selected. A side-biting aortic clamp can be used to mitigate the hemodynamic effect of an aortic cross-clamp. The tunnel to the SMA is created with gentle finger dissection in a retropancreatic plane, taking care to avoid injury to the SMV.\nWhat other options have been described for treatment of acute mesenteric ischemia?\nRetrograde open mesenteric stenting (ROMS)\nSo ROMS is a hybrid procedure involving an upper mid-line laparotomy that is used to evaluate the bowel. Through this incision, SMA exposure is obtained just as in a traditional open fashion at the root of the mesentery. The mid-SMA is then punctured under direct vision, and the area of disease is attempted to be treated from a retrograde approach back into the aorta. If bowel ischemia is found, the upper mid-line is easily lengthened into a traditional vertical laparotomy incision.\nEndovascular treatment (percutaneous thrombectomy / thrombolysis / pharmacomechanical thrombectomy)\nSome authors have described completely endovascular approaches to treatment of acute mesenteric ischemia. However, the major limitation is the inability to assess the bowel. These patients are frequently those who are deemed to be lower-risk for frank bowel ischemia or perforation, but the rates of laparotomy and bowel resection after these treatments have been described at over 20%. Probably not your first answer for oral boards.\n\n\n11.1.3 Other Etiologies\nWhat are some other, more rare etiologies of acute mesenteric ischemia?\nEmbolism is the most common etiology of acute mesenteric ischemia (40-50%), and thrombotic etiology composes another quarter to a third of these populations. The other two etiologies to consider are non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia and mesenteric venous thrombosis.\nPerfect, so how does a non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia (or NOMI) patient differ from what we’ve been talking about?\nSo NOMI patients typically do not have a focal lesion like you see with embolism or thrombosis. What happens to these patients is that classically they’re pretty sick patients with some predisposing factors, most commonly ESRD. On top of that, there was some clear inciting hemodynamic event causing sustained hypotension, such as recently getting a session of hemodialysis or undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass. The presentation is more indolent and less obvious than embolic or thrombotic acute mesenteric ischemia, and the imaging findings are more consistent with a diffuse vasospasm and hypovolemia picture.\nTreatment is primarily conservative, with the emphasis on resuscitation and addressing whatever the underlying etiology is. Adjuncts to this include placement of infusion catheters into the affected vessel with infusions of vasodilators (most commonly papaverine at 30-60mg/hr) or prostaglandin (Wyers, Mark C and Martin 2019; Trompeter et al. 2002) NOMI with portal venous gas, pneumatosis and free air often indicate need for laparotomy.\nHow about mesenteric venous thrombosis?\nThis is the most rare and most difficult to diagnose. They have a very slow course, frequently with a lot of other workup already done. There’s a wide variety of causes that have been reported, and any of the things that contribute to Virchow’s triad have been reported (thrombophilia from coagulopathy or malignancy, venous stasis from abdominal hypertension or obesity, direct injury from trauma, surgery, or inflammation). The diagnostic test of choice is a CT with portal vein contrast, which most commonly identifies thrombosis in the superior mesenteric vein (but can also involve the IMV, portal vein, or splenic vein). The treatment of choice is therapeutic anticoagulation.(Acosta and Björck 2019)"

    "section": "11.2 Chronic Mesenteric Ischemia",
    "text": "11.2 Chronic Mesenteric Ischemia\n\n11.2.1 Presentation and Evaluation\nHow does chronic mesenteric ischemia differ in its presentation?\nChronic mesenteric ischemia is characterized by post-prandial abdominal pain, typically 30-60 minutes after eating (think after gastric emptying time). This pain is usually severe, crampy, and resolves after minutes to hours of time. The pain leads to food fear and eventual unintentional weight loss. The next step in evaluation in these patients is a mesenteric duplex to evaluate for elevated velocities.\nHowever, the clinical presentation here is key. Chronic mesenteric ischemia is pretty unlikely in patients who do not have this constellation of clinical symptoms, and it’s really common for patients to be referred with imaging findings of elevated mesenteric velocities on duplex who have none of the clinical findings, and thus do not benefit from any intervention.\nWhat are the duplex criteria for chronic mesenteric ischemia?\nYeah, so really the two vessels we’re concerned with here are the celiac artery and the SMA. It’s pretty rare that stenosis of the IMA results in clinically significant ischemia, and also pretty rare that isolated disease of either the celiac or the SMA would be enough to cause significant symptoms. Typically you see the classic symptomatology of chronic mesenteric ischemia in patients with occlusive disease in both the celiac and the SMA.\nThe key numbers to remember here are peak systolic velocities (that’s PSV) of 200 cm/s for the celiac artery, and 275 cm/s for the SMA. These correspond to a stenosis of at least 70%. Remember, the superior mesenteric artery has higher velocity criteria, in case you forget. These classic numbers come from a study done in 1993, and many other studies have demonstrated other thresholds. Make sure to check with your friendly neighborhood vascular technician to see what the thresholds in your local lab are!\nIn addition to the PSV, you can also use the end diastolic velocity (EDV) to predict stenosis. For the EDV values in the celiac and the SMA, think approximately 50 cm/s predicts a stenosis of 50% (easy to remember, 50-50). This is known as Bowersox criteria, and is actually >45, but 50 is easier to remember.(Bowersox et al. 1991)\nYou can also predict a higher degree of stenosis with EDV values. This is easy for the SMA, where an EDV of 70 cm/s predicts a stenosis of 70% (70-70). For the celiac, it’s a bit higher, where an EDV of 100 cm/s predicts that same 70% stenosis.\nSo to review the numbers: (Moneta et al. 1991, 1993; Zwolak et al. 1998; AbuRahma et al. 2012)\n\nPSVs: 200 in the celiac or 275 in the SMA gives you 70% stenosis\nEDVs: 50s in the celiac or 50s in the SMA gives you 50% stenosis\nEDV #2: 100 in the celiac, or 70 in the SMA gives you 70% stenosis.\n\nFinal thought. When the celiac artery is severely narrowed or occluded, often you’ll have retrograde flow coming from the SMA via collaterals (these are your pancreaticoduodenal arcades via the GDA). You can see this as backwards flow in the common hepatic artery, and this has 100% specificity for disease in the celiac artery.(Warncke et al. 2019)\n\n\n11.2.2 Management\nWhat’s next in the approach to these patients?\nFrequently they’re going to get some kind of axial imaging, either CTA or MRA, to help plan for their revascularization, although this isn’t strictly necessary. Often endovascular approaches are the mainstay of treatment. Remember that the angle of the SMA frequently favors a brachial approach, although you can also engage the SMA from a femoral approach with preformed catheters (think Sos, Cobra, etc) or steerable sheaths. Remember to watch out for median nerve compression from brachial sheath hematomas if you’ve opted for a percutaneous brachial approach, with a low threshold to evacuate the hematoma and perform median nerve decompression if the patient develops and symptoms in the median nerve distribution postoperatively. Also remember that a brachial sheath hematoma will not be easily palpable or visible at the skin level, so the neurologic exam postoperatively is key.\nSingle vessel SMA revascularization is widely accepted for chronic mesenteric ischemia without necessarily needing to revascularize the celiac axis. (Gustavo S. Oderich and Ribeiro 2019; Foley et al. 2000)\nAny other technical tips for endo intervention on the mesenteric arteries?\nThe best view for diagnostic angiography in mesenteric ischemia is the lateral view.\nMost often balloon-expandable stents are selected for the mesenteric circulation. The precision of deployment and the increased hoop strength of a balloon expandable stent make them more favorable here over the radial force of a self-expanding stent. You can also flare the proximal end of a balloon-expandable stent into the aorta, making sure that you’ve really treated any ostial disease. Some authors advocate for use of embolic protection devices to prevent distal embolism, and other authors also advocate for the use of covered stents for the mesenteric circulation due to better patency.(Gustavo S. Oderich et al. 2013; Gustavo S. Oderich and Ribeiro 2019)\nWhat is the surveillance protocol for an SMA stent?\nAt most institutions it is 1mo, 6mo and annually thereafter.(Mohler et al. 2012; Zierler et al. 2018)\nHow about open revascularization?\nIn most centers, up to 80% of CMI is treated endovascularly. Open is often reserved for those that fail endovascular therapy.(Gustavo S. Oderich, Gloviczki, and Bower 2010; Gustavo S. Oderich and Ribeiro 2019)\nSo we talked a lot about open revascularization earlier in the acute mesenteric ischemia segment. The techniques are broadly similar, with the exception that often for chronic mesenteric ischemia, frequently you’ll be planning to revascularize both the celiac and the SMA. The approach for this is with a bifurcated graft from the supraceliac aorta, taking one limb down to the celiac artery, and the other limb tunneled in a retropancreatic fashion to the mid-SMA. Remember that this approach requires a supraceliac aortic cross clamp, which your patient may not be able to tolerate. But single revascularization of SMA is often acceptable with appropriate collaterals. Taking a retrograde bypass off of the common iliac artery as we previously described may be a better option for patients with significant comorbidities. A further option that completely avoids a bypass is to go right for a trapdoor endarterectomy of the celiac artery and the SMA, allowing you to address coral reef or proximal/ostial disease (such as flush occlusions) that are difficult to treat endovascularly."

    "text": "11.4 Median Arcuate Ligament Syndrome (MALS)\nCan you tell me about median arcuate ligament syndrome and how that differs from chronic mesenteric ischemia?\nMedian arcuate ligament syndrome (MALS), which has many names (Dunbar syndrome, celiac axis compression syndrome, etc.) is a somewhat controversial entity that occurs when repeated compression of the celiac artery occurs against the median arcuate ligament during respiratory variation. The thing you want to visualize here is that during full exhalation, the lungs are completely emptied, and the diaphragm moves up at a sharper angle. This angulation kinks off the celiac artery more severely, so velocities in exhalation are higher in MALS. However, these findings are common in asymptomatic patients, and so just like chronic mesenteric ischemia, the clinical presentation is key. They’ll have a similar presentation as chronic mesenteric ischemia patients, with post-prandial pain, food fear, and weight loss, but often the symptomatology is a little more indolent in these patients. Because of this, these patients have frequently gotten the million dollar workup for nonspecific GI pain. Duplex ultrasound of shows celiac PSV >200 and EDV >50, normalizes during deep inspiration, and post-stenotic spectral broadening.(Zwolak et al. 1998)\nThe treatment of choice for suspected MALS is a laparoscopic median arcuate ligament release, frequently performed by a MIS/foregut surgeon. A key point here is that you don’t want to be fooled into putting a stent in these patients before they’ve gotten their median arcuate ligament release, because the dynamic motion of the diaphragm is likely to crimp or bend the stent if that hasn’t been treated yet. It may be that some patients benefit from endovascular treatment after release, though, as some think that the chronic damage from MALS can result in intimal damage/scarring that persists even after the extrinsic compression is treated by the median arcuate ligament release."

    "text": "11.5 SMA Syndrome\nWhat is SMA syndrome?\nSMA syndrome, also called Wilkie’s Syndrome is a rare entity where the 3rd portion of the duodenum gets compressed between the SMA and the aorta, causing a functional gastric outlet obstruction. Patients are typically emaciated, having lost a significant amount of weight before their symptom onset. What’s happened is they’ve lost the retroperitoneal fat pat that normally surrounds the SMA, and so the angle between the SMA and the aorta becomes more acute, pinching off the duodenum.\nClassic findings in fluoroscopic swallow in SMA syndrome are delayed gastric emptying, a dilated duodenum, to and fro peristalsis in the proximal duodenum and cutoff in the third portion. EGD can show pulsation in the 3rd portion of the duodenum.(Warncke et al. 2019)\nThe treatment of choice here is enteral feeding with a nasojejunal tube or other surgically placed tube and TPN, because what really will help them here is weight gain. GJ bypass or duodenal mobilization is sometimes needed for treatment, but is controversial. It’s not really a mesenteric vascular disease, but it sometimes shows up on exams as a related entity.(Welsch, Büchler, and Kienle 2007; Merrett et al. 2009)"

    "text": "12.1 Pathophysiology\nWhat is renovascular hypertension?\nHypertension as a result of progressive renal artery stenosis. While renal artery stenosis is a relatively common finding in older patients with hypertension, it’s relatively uncommon as the primary cause of hypertension.\nWhat is ischemic nephropathy?\nDecreased renal function and/or chronic kidney disease that results from atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis due to a reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and rise in creatinine produced by any cause of diminished renal blood flow. Primary mechanism is chronic hypoperfusion. (Rickey and Geary 2019)\nWho is at risk for ischemic nephropathy?\nRenal injury can develop in anyone with a kidney or kidney region beyond a critically stenotic artery\nNow, this is usually in patients with atherosclerotic disease, but any flow limiting lesion—such as coarctation of the aorta, mid-aortic syndrome, or fibromuscular dyplasia– can cause ischemic neuropathy OR renovascular hypertension.\nThe prevalence of renovascular hypertension in patients with mild hypertension is probably less than 1 %. However in patients with acute progression, severe or refractory hypertension the prevalence may be as high as 10 to 40%.\nThat’s the best you can do, 10-40%? That’s a big window.\nYes, and it illustrates the biggest issue we have with renovascular disease. We know 5-22 % of patients 50 years or older who have advanced CKD have some degree of renal artery stenosis and 23 to 54% of these patients have bilateral renal artery disease.\n\nBilateral renal arterial stenosis is associated with more widespread atherosclerotic disease, higher serum creatinine levels, and higher mortality than unilateral disease\nRenal artery revascularization among patients in these studies infrequently produced a meaningful recovery of kidney function, which would have supported the diagnosis\n\nSo not everyone with flow limitations to their renal vascular will get renovascular hypertension or ischemic nephropathy?\nNot at all, actually. Flow limiting lesions may be an “incidental” finding in patients who have CKD or hypertension that is caused by a separate disorder (i.e. diabetic nephropathy and essential/primary hypertension).\nBecause of this, it can be very difficult to distinguish between patient whose disease is induced by renal artery stenosis and those who have alternative causes of CKD or renovascular hypertension.\nSo you’re telling me that we have no idea who has clinically significant disease and who doesn’t?\nNo. Fortunately there are clinical findings that suggest that renovascular disease is an underlying cause:\n\nRecent or rapid development of severe hypertension.\n\nRelatively specific for renovascular hypertension and is the strongest predictor of anti-hypertensive benefit from revascularization.\n\nSevere hypertension that may be treatment resistant.\n\nSome patients with ischemic nephropathy are normotensive, which may be due in part to a reduced cardiac output\n\nAcute rise in serum creatinine following the administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs).\n\nRise in serum creatinine is more common with agents that block the renin-angiotensin system than with other antihypertensive drugs because glomerular filtration rate (GFR) often depends upon the efferent arteriolar actions of angiotensin II in this setting.\nMore common with bilateral as compared with unilateral disease because there is hemodynamic compromise to the entire renal functional mass\nThis usually resolves after withdrawal of the drug.\nRestoring the renal blood supply in such cases can recover the ability to use these drugs for blood pressure control.\n\nSignificant variability of serum creatinine concentration that may be due to changes in volume status\nA rapid rise in arterial pressure associated with sudden development of left ventricular failure (“flash pulmonary edema”).\n\nThis finding is more common with renal artery stenosis because bilateral disease is also associated with diuretic resistance and sympathetic adrenergic activation\n\nDeterioration of kidney function after placement of an endovascular aortic stent graft – IATROGENIC\n\nEVAR with isolated L renal coverage -> splenal renal bypass, ligate splenic artery distally and then perform end-to-end anastomosis to renal artery. (Benjamin and Hansen 2019)\n\n\nSo it matters which kidney is affected or if it’s one or both?\nYes, effect of the stenosis may not be clinically apparent due to compensatory function of the unaffected contralateral kidney\nMost cases of renal artery stenosis affect one side much more than the other; one kidney is affected with the second kidney being essentially normal, hence the designation “unilateral” disease.\n\nIn patients with unilateral renal artery stenosis, contralateral kidney is damaged by uncontrolled hypertension and circulating angiotensin II and aldosterone. (Rickey and Geary 2019)\n\nPatients who are diagnosed with ischemic nephropathy usually have high-grade stenosis of both renal arteries or stenosis to a solitary functioning kidney.\n\nIt is this subpopulation of the disease that merits specific consideration because of its additional contribution to fluid retention, loss of kidney function, and congestive heart failure.\n\nWhat are the pathophysiological mechanisms at play here?\nLike we said, first you need a flow limitation. We mentioned several, but by in large There are two major causes of renal artery stenosis:\n\nAtherosclerosis – you’ll generally see this in patients over 45 years old, likely with known PVD/CAD—though it can occur as an isolated renal lesion—usually involving the aortic orifice or the proximal main renal artery.\nFibromuscular dysplasia – These patients are most often women under the age of 50 years and typically involves the mid- or distal main renal artery or the intrarenal branches.\n\nRarely iatrogenic from malposition or migration of endovascular aortic stent grafts over the renal orifices.\n\nTakayasu’s arteritis - although a rare cause of renovascular hypertension, this is the most common presentation of Takayasu’s arteritis (60%). First line therapy is open revascularization. (Ehlert and Abularrage 2019; Weaver et al. 2004; Zhu et al. 2012)\n\nI think the flow limitation part has been well established. What next?\nRenal (especially bilateral) hypoperfusion induces activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system which increases vascular tone and impairs sodium excretion resulting in expansion of the extracellular fluid volume."

    "text": "12.2 Management\n\n12.2.1 Medical Management and Evaluation\nCan’t we just treat their hypertension and give these patients an ACE inhibitor at this point?\nSure. And oftentimes we do. In fact, many of these patients can be treated with medical therapy without loss of function or irreversible fibrosis, sometimes for many years\nSome in-human studies demonstrate that even with moderate reduction in renal perfusion pressure (40%) and in renal blood flow (30%), GFR may be reduced but renal cortex and medulla tissue oxygenation may be able to adapt and avoid developing severe hypoxia. However, there are limits to this adaptation.\nExplain that…\nAs the hypertension is treated, we’re lowering the pressure gradient across the stenosis and can actually increase the degree of renal malperfusion and worsen the renal function. Oftentimes this loss of kidney function is a reversible consequence of antihypertensive therapy but it limits our ability to control the hypertension medically without causing further damage to the kidney.\nFurther reduction in renal function can also reflect progressive narrowing of the renal arteries and/or progressive intrinsic kidney disease as more advanced vascular occlusion, corresponding to a 70 to 80% narrowing of the renal artery, leads to demonstrable cortical hypoxia.\nCan we tell who has cortical hypoxia through diagnostic tests?\nTo some degree. Cortical perfusion can be measured by blood oxygen level dependent magnetic resonance (BOLD-MR). Additionally, inflammatory markers sampled from renal veins of stenotic kidneys correlated strongly with the degree of hypoxia (as measured by BOLD-MR), particularly after correction of the stenosis with angioplasty\nSo we have a patient with evidence of malperfused kidneys, either through worsening renal function or uncontrolled hypertension, with known discrete stenoses, and we even got a BOLD-MRI which confirms it. Let’s just revascularize them and be done with it?\nNot so fast. Although vascular stenosis or occlusion can initiate these processes, long-standing ischemia causes parenchymal injury characterized by inflammation and fibrosis which eventually becomes an irreversible process. At some point, restoring renal blood flow provides no recovery of kidney function or clinical benefit.\nSo how can we determine who has CKD or hypertension due to renovascular stenosis that we can actually help?\nThis is probably the most important question since in this whole disease process.\nTo start, if a patient has the clinical manifestations of ischemic nephropathy or renovascular hypertension as we discussed above, a presumptive diagnosis of ischemic nephropathy can be made if there is radiologic documentation of significant stenosis (usually more than 70 % luminal occlusion) of both renal arteries or of one renal artery to a solitary functioning kidney.\nBut how do we know the vascular occlusive disease posing critical hemodynamic limitation to kidney function?\n\nGenerally, luminal occlusion of at least 60 to 75 % is required to limit blood flow and reduce perfusion pressure\nThis degree of stenosis is usually associated with a measurable translesional “pull-back” pressure gradient of 10 to 15 mmHg.\nDoppler ultrasound criteria (Hoffmann et al. 1991; Zierler and Dawson 2016)\n\nPeak systolic velocities above >170 cm/sec with post stenotic turbulence to identify less than 60 % luminal stenosis.\nRenal aortic ratio >3.5 required to diagnose greater than 60% stenosis.\nElevated velocities can be seen with tortuosity, but this should be able to be confirmed with B-mode.\n\nBlood Oxygen Level Dependent Magnetic Resonance (BOLD-MR) can identify levels of cortical hypoxia which may be associated PSV > 385 cm/sec or reduced GFR (20 to 25 ml/min).\nMRA can be used for evaluation\n\nPro - no radiation, good imaging of distal renal arteries, no degradation from ostial calcium.\nCons - requires GAD -> interstitial fibrosis in CKD (Galan, Cowper, and Bucala 2006) and degrades with motion and respiration (Nelson et al. 1999)\n\n\nMost importantly: is the condition of the kidneys such that restoring renal blood flow is likely to benefit function?\nShort answer, we still can’t be certain.\nLong answer, we can at least have some idea by considering the renal resistive index, the six-month trajectory of kidney function, and the size of the kidneys or by performing a kidney biopsy (which is not usually done).\n\nNone of these factors predict the outcome of revascularization with certainty.\nImproved and validated methods to evaluate the salvageability of kidney function in this disorder are greatly needed and are the holy grail of this disease process.\n\nLet’s go through some of these:\nRenal Resistive index:\nSome studies indicate that elevated resistive indices in segmental vessels (above 0.80) measured by duplex ultrasound denote poor prognosis for renal recovery while a low resistive index is a favorable sign.\nTrajectory of kidney function\nThe most consistent predictor of good recovery of kidney function after revascularization has been a recent deterioration of kidney function (ie, in the prior six to twelve months). Similarly recent progression of hypertension is a sign of likely good recovery.\nKidney size\nVery small kidneys (less than 8 cm in longest diameter) are usually considered unlikely to recover after revascularization.\nKidney biopsy - not usually performed\nPrevious studies suggest that biopsy demonstrating preexisting atheroembolic changes and interstitial fibrosis indicate a limited potential for recovery.\nComparison of kidney morphology with kidney function\nSome investigators have recommended assessing morphological parameters, such as renal parenchymal volume and cortical thickness with MRI, and comparing these parameters with kidney function measured by radionuclide scanning\n\nA kidney with normal morphology in the setting of renal artery stenosis and reduced function may indicate a “hibernating kidney” which may respond to revascularization.\n\nSo how do we get a definitive diagnosis?\nA definitive diagnosis is not usually made before revascularization. In practice, confirmation of the diagnosis is based upon stabilization or improvement of the GFR after successful revascularization.\nNow we think our patient’s renal artery stenosis maybe is causing hypertension or decline in renal function and we can possibly reverse it… how do we treat it?\nFor starters, all of these patients should receive medical therapy to control their hypertension in addition to routine CKD care and surveillance. They need to be aggressively treated for secondary prevention of cardiovascular morbidity with aspirin, statins, cessation of smoking, and, in patients with diabetes, glycemic control.\nSecond, once diagnosis has been made we have 2 therapeutic alternatives… Which are?\nFirst, medical therapy alone- this generally involves ACE-I or ARB and as we discussed.\nRAS can worsen ACE-I and ARB induced renal dysfunction due to systemic hypotension, efferent arterial vasodilation, and reduced glomerular hydrostatic pressure, in turn lowering GFR. [(Rickey and Geary 2019; Schoolwerth et al. 2001)]\nOkay, in other words we can have chronic normalization of the systemic pressure that might eventually lead to ischemic atrophy due to the reduced renal perfusion pressure distal to the stenosis? Any other concerns with medical management alone?\n\nWe’re addressing or prevention progression of stenosis in those with atherosclerotic disease.\n\nSince this isn’t a vascular medicine podcast, what’s our other option?\nProcedural intervention (open or endovascular) along with medical therapy.\nNow you’re talking. Who should we fix operatively?\nSome but not all patients should undergo revascularization, Patient selection single most important factor.\nDepends upon the hemodynamic severity and likely recoverability of kidney function\nYou mentioned recoverability before, can you once again touch on some recoverability indicators?\n\nA recent onset of hypertension prior to the diagnosis of renal artery stenosis (strongest predictor of response to treatment)\nFailure of optimal medical therapy to control the blood pressure\nIntolerance to optimal medical therapy (i.e. deterioration of renal function during antihypertensive drug therapy)\nRecurrent flash pulmonary edema and/or refractory heart failure\nOtherwise unexplained progressive renal insufficiency, particularly if proteinuria is absent\nCKD stage 3a and 3b most likely to benefit from revascularization. (Singer et al. 2009)\n\nLower GFR likely to progress to ESRD\n\nDegree of stenosis, age, pre-procedure BP control and meds are not associated with improvement. (Textor, Misra, and Oderich 2013)\n\n\n\n12.2.2 Endovascular\nBut do we have any good data proving our interventions help?\nThis is where things can get muddy.\nEarly on, observational studies demonstrated a high rate of procedural success with percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA) and stent placement (~85%) in patients with ostial atherosclerotic disease, as well as a high rate of clinical success measured by improvements in blood pressure and kidney function in 50 to 75 % of subjects.\nAnything better than observational studies?\nUnfortunately, randomized trials showed no additional benefit from stenting when added to medical therapy with respect to blood pressure control, renal function, cardiovascular events, and mortality. But these studies have their own limitations.\nThe one we keep hearing about is the CORAL trial.(Cooper et al. 2014) Tell me about that.\n\nCardiovascular Outcomes in Renal Atherosclerotic Lesions (CORAL) trial\n947 patients (80 % had unilateral disease) who met the following two criteria:\n\nUnilateral or bilateral atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis >60 % if diagnosed with conventional angiography, peak systolic velocity >300 cm/second if diagnosed by duplex Doppler ultrasonography, Luminal narrowing >80 % if diagnosed with magnetic resonance angiography or computerized tomography angiography (or >70 % with additional evidence of renal ischemia)\nSystolic hypertension despite two or more antihypertensive medications and/or an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 ml/min/1.73 m2 that was presumably due to the stenosis.\nAll patients received antiplatelet therapy plus best medical therapy including ARB\n\nRevascularization had no additional effect on the primary outcome (a composite of cardiovascular or renal death, stroke, myocardial infarction, hospitalization for heart failure, a reduction in eGFR by more than 30 %, or end-stage renal disease) as compared with medical therapy alone (35.1 versus 35.8 %).\nNo effect on any of the individual components of the primary outcome.\nLow procedural complication rate ~2%\nSimilar findings in the ASTRAL trial (Investigators 2009)\n\nWell, that sounds pretty convincing, however there are limitations on existing treatment data:\nConsiderable selection bias – For the most part, the patients enrolled in these trials did not meet the criteria for selecting patients likely to benefit from intervention (i.e. short duration of blood pressure elevation, hypertension resistant to medical therapy, recurrent flash pulmonary edema):\n\nCORAL (Cooper et al. 2014)\n\nPatients hospitalized for heart failure within 30 days of screening for the trial were excluded, thereby limiting the number of trial participants with recurrent flash pulmonary edema.\nMean number of antihypertensive medications used by CORAL participants at baseline was 2.1- many had not failed optimal medical therapy\nMore than 25 % had controlled blood pressure upon entry into the trial.\nMortality and event rates lower than in most previous registries, suggesting that many high-risk patients were not enrolled.\n\nASTRAL (Investigators 2009)\n\nLarge number of patients had stenoses that were probably not clinically significant (50 to 70 %), and patients were excluded if their primary doctors felt that they “definitely” needed revascularization.\n\n\nResults of the trials differ substantially from observational reports of “high-risk” subsets\n\nFor the most part, patients selected by their treating clinicians to undergo revascularization have derived greater benefit from revascularization than did patients enrolled in the trials who were randomly assigned to revascularization\n\nWe’ve determined our patient is an appropriate candidate for intervention, and we don’t fully buy into CORAL, what can we do?\nPercutaneous renal angioplasty/stenting in addition to medical therapy are most commonly employed if technically feasible.\nMost amenable lesions to angioplasty are those producing incomplete occlusion in the main renal artery.\n\nTotal occlusions and ostial lesions extending into aorta generally do not respond well to angioplasty alone due to elastic recoil.\n\nQuick results: maximum antihypertensive response is generally observed at 48 hours after the procedure\n\nBut BP levels and antihypertensive drug requirements often change over subsequent weeks\n\nIn general, the effects of revascularization on blood pressure were greater in bilateral disease, but effects on renal function and mortality did not differ in those with bilateral as compared with unilateral stenosis .\nMost atherosclerotic lesions are now treated with primary stenting to avoid rapid development of restenosis.\n\nA higher initial primary success rate, defined as less than 50 % stenosis (88 versus 57 %).\nAt six months, a higher patency rate (75 versus 29 %) and a lower restenosis rate (14 versus 48 %).\nTwelve patients assigned to PTRA alone underwent stenting because of treatment failure within six months. These patients had a similar blood pressure response as those initially treated with stenting.\n\nPerforming a renal angiogram (Edwards and Cooper 2019)\n\nSupine with arms overhead or straight out to the sides\nLAO 15-20deg\nFlush catheter placed just above the renals\nBreath hold, high frame rate and non-DSA due unavoidable patient movement\n\n\n12.2.2.1 Complications\nWhat about complications?\nComplication rate with percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty with or without stenting is between 5 and 15 %\n\nMostly minor: puncture site hematoma and renal artery dissection.\nSerious complications more rare: renal artery thrombosis or perforation, AKI 2/2 atheroembolic disease (~1%)or radiocontrast agent injury.\nMortality exceedingly rare\n\n\n\n12.2.2.2 Outcomes\nUnilateral disease\n\nPTRA alone results in normalization of blood pressure (removal of antihypertensive drug therapy) ~8-20%\nSome improvement 50-60%\nFailure rate ~20-30%\nRestenosis rate of 8 to 30 % at two years (without stent)\nBetter results with unilateral fibromuscular disease.\nLess consistent for patients with chronic hypertension compared with patients who have an acute elevation in blood pressure\n\nBilateral disease\n\n25-30% will recover kidney function to a meaningful degree, sometimes avoiding progression to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and/or the need for renal replacement therapy.\n~50% will have little immediate change in kidney function but will “stabilize”\n~20% will have a progressive deterioration of kidney function, sometimes related to the procedure\n\nGuidelines\n\n2005 ACC/AHA guidelines on peripheral artery disease recommends that a stent be placed in patients undergoing PTRA for treatment of atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (Hirsch et al. 2006)\n\nPTRA without stent placement is rarely performed unless the anatomy precludes stenting.\nPOBA without stenting is generally less successful and associated with more complications (i.e. atheroemboli)\n\n\nHow durable is PTA/stenting?\n\nRestenosis\n\n~11-17%\n\n11-39% during the first one to two years\n\nDetected as a rise in blood pressure requiring more intensive therapy\nAngioplasty/stenting injures the vascular endothelium, which may result in restenosis.\nSymptomatic stenosis leading to a rise in blood pressure or a fall in GFR are less common and are reported in 10 to 20 % of patients\n\n\nHow do you follow these patients after stenting?\n\nFollow-up of patients who have had a renal artery stent should include serial measurements of blood pressure and estimation of GFR.\n\nPost-stent duplex ultrasound at 2-4weeks with\nRepeated examinations on a quarterly basis (not much data)\nPatients who develop an increase in pressure or reduced GFR after stenting should undergo duplex ultrasonography to identify restenosis\nRetreatment with angioplasty with or without repeat stenting can be attempted, but the restenosis rate after repeat angioplasty is increased.\n\nSurgical reconstruction may be pursued in patients with recurrent episodes of restenosis and loss of kidney function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12.2.3 Open Surgery\nWhat about an open operation?\nSurgical revascularization used in addition to medical therapy is less common since the widespread application of effective antihypertensive drug therapy and endovascular stents in the mid 1990s.\nSo who still gets open repair? (Benjamin and Hansen 2019)\n\nYounger patients\nUnfavorable anatomy (i.e. occlusion or branch disease)\nFailures of endovascular therapy (i.e. in stent restenosis)\nNeed for concomittent aortic revascularization.\n\nHow do we do it?\nInvolves bypassing the stenotic segment or of removing a small atrophic kidney with nearly complete arterial occlusion.\n\nFrom the aorta or hepatorenal or splenorenal bypass to avoid diseased aorta.\nBilateral: either bilateral repair or unilateral repair with contralateral nephrectomy of a nonfunctional, atrophic kidney.\n\nBilateral ostial disease in a young patient can be treated with transverse arteriotomy and bilateral renal endarterectomy. Close primarily or with PTFE/polyester patch. Second line is bilateral bypass with GVS. (Benjamin and Hansen 2019)\nHow do outcomes compare to PTA/stenting?\nEqually or more effective than PTRA in the treatment of atherosclerotic disease, with cure of or improvement in the hypertension occurring in 80 to 95 % of patients.\n\nCure of hypertension after surgery is most likely in patients who have been hypertensive for less than five years\n\nLack of complete response was usually associated with one of two factors:\n\nPresence of underlying primary/essential hypertension\nDevelopment of intrarenal vascular disease due to exposure of the contralateral kidney to the elevated blood pressure.\n\nGuidelines recommendations?\n2005 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines (Hirsch et al. 2006) Open surgery is reserved primarily for patients with:\n\nMultiple small renal arteries\nEarly primary branching of the main renal artery\nRequire aortic reconstruction near the renal arteries for other indications (i.e. aneurysm repair or severe aortoiliac occlusive disease)\nIn order to avoid manipulation of a highly diseased aorta or failed endovascular stents, using extra-anatomic bypass (i.e. splenorenal, ileorenal, or hepatorenal bypass).\n\nSo why not do it instead of stent?\nIn-hospital mortality: ~3-10 % in high volume centers\n\nRisk factors diffuse atherosclerosis, advanced age, chronic kidney disease, heart failure, or chronic lung disease.\nNo deaths in 105 procedures for fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD)."

    "text": "12.3 Fibromuscular Dysplasia (FMD)\n\n12.3.1 Demographics\nYou mentioned FMD as a cause of renovascular hypertension, tell me more about that…\nFibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is a non-atherosclerotic, non-inflammatory disorder that results in progressive arterial stenosis, occlusion, aneurysm, dissection, or tortuosity.(Olin and Sealove 2011)\n\nVirtually always diagnosed radiographically – formerly pathologically, but rarely sent for specimen in modern diagnosis or treatment\n\nHow do we classify it?\nMost commonly classified by angiographic appearance:\n\nMultifocal FMD (more common)\n\nAngiographic appearance of a “string of beads.”\nCorresponds pathologically to medial fibroplasia, the most common histologic type, and to perimedial fibroplasia, which is less common.\n\nFocal FMD (less common)\n\nAngiographic appearance of a “circumferential or tubular stenosis”\nCorresponds pathologically to intimal fibroplasia but medial hyperplasia and peri-arterial hyperplasia may also have a focal appearance.\n\nThese two different angiographic subtypes of FMD (multifocal and focal) have different phenotypic presentations and natural history. If FMD is, in fact, a single disease?\n\nWhere does it occur?\nFMD has been observed in nearly every arterial bed. Two thirds of patients have multiple arteries involved.\n\nInvolvement of the renal arteries ~75-80%\nInvolvement of the extracranial cerebrovascular arteries (i.e. carotid and vertebral arteries) ~75%\n\nWho has FMD?\n\n~90% of cases in adults are in women.\n\nNo female predominance among children with FMD.\n\nMean age at diagnosis was 52 years, with a range of 5 to 86 years\n\nIn the past, it was believed that FMD was a disease of young women. However, older now know to make up a large proportion of affected\n\n35-50% of cases in children and 5-10% of cases in adults under the age of 60 years with renovascular hypertension\nOften an incidental finding:\n\n4.4% of potential kidney donors had evidence of FMD.\nCORAL trial:\n\nFMD was discovered in 5.7% of the total study population (8.8% of enrolled females)\n\n\n\n\n12.3.1.1 Etiology\nWhat causes FMD?\nThe exact etiology of FMD remains unknown, but some mechanisms have been proposed\n\nMost often results from medial fibroplasia (60-90% of cases). Collagen deposits in the media result in elastic fibrils and fibromuscular ridges. (Olin et al. 2014)\n’Genetics may play an important role in development\n\nSome studies report autosomal mode of inheritance with variable penetrance\nPotential association with a single nucleotide variant in the phosphatase and actin regulator 1 gene (PHACTR1)\nVariant rs9349379 is also a risk locus for coronary artery disease, migraine headache, and cervical artery dissection.\n\nPredominance of young/childbearing age women hormonal influences are thought to play a role\n\nRemains unproven.\n\nMechanical factors such as stretch and trauma unproven.\n\n\n\n12.3.1.2 Presentation\nDoes FMD present differently that the atherosclerotic renovascular disease we talked about?\n\nVaries widely depending on artery affected and as it results from:\nIschemia related to stenosis\nDissection and occlusion of major arteries (renal infarction, stroke, myocardial infarction)\nRupture of aneurysms\nEmbolization of intravascular thrombi from dissection or aneurysms\n\nWhat are the common presenting symptoms and signs\nManifestations of renal FMD (i.e. hypertension, flank pain) are more likely to occur in men, as are arterial dissections and aneurysms.\n\nMost common presenting signs:\nHypertension – 67% (66% of women and 74 % of men)\n\nBut overall hypertension is the most common manifestation of renal artery FMD in both genders\n\nFlank pain and abdominal pain can result from ischemia, aneurysm rupture, or dissection of renal and mesenteric arteries, respectively.\n\nAre these dissections common?\n\nHigh prevalence of aneurysm and/or dissection\n\nAneurysm (22%) and dissection (26%).\n\n34% of aneurysms were renal\n11% of dissections were renal\n\n42% had an aneurysm and/or dissection.\n\n\nSo should we screen for these dissections in a patient with known FMD?\n\nEvery patient diagnosed with FMD should have one-time, head-to-pelvic CTA (or MRA) is an alternative.\n\nCTA of the neck and head on one day followed one week later by CTA of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis\n\n\nWhen should we suspect FMD?\n\nHypertension (particularly in a woman under the age of 60 years) with findings that would prompt an evaluation for secondary hypertension:\n\nSevere or resistant hypertension.\nOnset of hypertension before the age of 35 years.\nA sudden rise in blood pressure over a previously stable baseline.\nA significant increase in the serum creatinine concentration after the institution of therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) in the absence of an excessive reduction in blood pressure.\nAn epigastric/abdominal bruit.\n\nRenal artery dissection (or carotid, vertebral, coronary)\nAneurysm in a visceral, carotid, vertebral, or intracranial vessel.\nRenal infarction.\n\n\n\n\n12.3.2 Evaluation\nHow do we diagnose this and/or distinguish it from renovascular atherosclerotic disease?\n\nConfirmed by diagnostic imaging that reveals consistent findings\nNoninvasive imaging test is usually performed first. This includes CTA, MRA, and Duplex ultrasound.\n\nLet talk about CTA…\n\nCTA is preferable due to higher spatial resolution than MRA, less dependence upon technical expertise, and a shorter scan time\nExcellent diagnostic accuracy for FMD of the main renal arteries, although the sensitivity decreases when FMD is only present in the smaller branch renal arteries.\nMulti-row detector CT scanners may provide additional advantages in diagnosis and surveillance because they offer more rapid image acquisition, variable section thickness, three-dimensional rendering, diminished helical artifacts, and smaller contrast requirements.\n\nWhat about MRA?\n\nInconsistent detection of FMD and is performed if CTA is contraindicated\nThe spatial resolution in the branch vessels is not adequate, and artifact may occur, suggesting “beading” when none is present.\nMay miss mild FMD.\nCan be useful for detecting aneurysms and dissections - can be difficult to diagnose on duplex ultrasonography.(Renaud et al. 2012)\n\nAnd finally, Duplex ultrasonography\n\nDetects elevated blood flow velocities in the mid and distal portions of the renal artery, most common locations for FMD.\nIncreased peak systolic velocity, turbulent blood flow, and tortuosity of the mid and distal artery.\n\n% diameter stenosis reports less helpful and usually inaccurate\n\nlowest spatial resolution of all of the cross-sectional imaging modalities\nmost operator dependence\nfirst choice only in high-volume centers with extensive expertise in this technique\n\nWhat about non invasive testing?\n\nDSA is performed in patients if there is a high clinical suspicion of FMD, and treatment with revascularization is planned if a stenosis is found.\n\nCan improve visualization of the arteries by eliminating background soft tissue and bone and has higher spatial resolution than any of the other imaging modalities\nCan measure the pressure gradient across the stenosis\n\nPressure decrease threshold of 10 % or more of the mean pressure should be used to decide whether a lesion is hemodynamically significant\nIVUS and optical coherence tomography (OCT) can help identify dissection or intramural hematoma or determine response to angioplasty.\n\nNegative DSA excludes a diagnosis of FMD in the vascular bed that was imaged.\n\n\nAny place for pathological diagnosis in modern therapy?\n\nHistopathology (and histologic classification) is no longer part of the diagnosis.\n\nOnly in the rare patient who requires surgical revascularization or resection of an aneurysm.\n\n\n\n\n12.3.3 Management\n\n12.3.3.1 Medical Management\nSo how do we treat this, what warrants intervention and are those interventions different than what we offer atherosclerotic disease of the renal arteries?\n\nAll patients with FMD should be placed on antiplatelet therapy (ASA) unless otherwise contraindicated\nAntihypertensive therapy\n\nMost patients will require antihypertensive therapy, even if they undergo revascularization.\nMajority of patients with focal FMD have their blood pressure cured with angioplasty\n\n\n\n\n12.3.3.2 Endovascular\nBut what about revascularization?\n\nRevascularization Goal: control of hypertension\n\nBP can be controlled in most adults with multifocal FMD with a mean of two antihypertensive medications\nWeigh risks and benefits in well controlled hypertension.\n\nNo randomized trials comparing revascularization with medical therapy\n\nWell then who do we treat?\n\nRecent-onset hypertension, with goal to cure hypertension.\nResistant hypertension despite compliance with an appropriate three-drug regimen.\nPatients unable to tolerate antihypertensive medications or who are non-compliant with their medication regimen.\nAdults with bilateral renal FMD, or unilateral renal FMD to a single functioning kidney, and unexplained progressive renal insufficiency thought to result from renal artery stenosis\nHypertensive children.\nmay be at higher risk than adults for progressive renal parenchymal loss, and therefore could benefit from revascularization even if their hypertension can be well-controlled with one or two antihypertensive medications.\n\nAnd what kind of results do we get with revascularization?\nHypertension is cured or improved following revascularization in a large proportion of patients with FMD.\n\nMuch better than 2/2 atherosclerosis\nVaries considerably from study to study, although hypertension control improves in most patients and depends in large part upon the definition of cure.\nNot good data on stabilization of either GFR or renal size in patients with FMD.\n\nWhat options do we have in terms of revascularization and do we have good results treating FMD with endovascular or open interventions?\n\nPatients most often treated with angioplasty alone with good success. (Davies et al. 2008; Jenkins et al. 2015)\nImprovement in blood pressure (including those with and without cure) was similar with PTA as compared with surgery (86 versus 88 %).\nOlder age and longer duration of hypertension prior to revascularization were significantly associated with a lower cure rate.\n\nHow do these compare?\n\nPTA achieves similar technical success and is associated with a lower risk of adverse events in observational studies\nMost patients with FMD who are selected for renal revascularization have PTA rather than surgery\nMajor adverse events were more frequent with surgery (15 versus 6 %).\n\nSo why choose open surgery?\n\nCure rates were higher with surgery (54 versus 36 %).\nSurgery rather than PTA if PTA fails or if the arterial anatomy is not amenable to PTA\n\nPatients with small renal arteries (<4 mm), with branch renal artery disease, or with extensive intimal fibroplasia.\n\n\nSo how do we perform Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty for FMD?\n\nAngioplasty is often performed through a transfemoral approach, but concomitant stenting is rare, unlike PTA for atherosclerotic RAS\n\nWhy not place a stent?\n\nPatients do very well with angioplasty alone, no reason to place a stent.\n\nLesion is so fibrotic that the pressure gradient cannot be obliterated with an angioplasty, a stent will not correct this problem\n\nSuch patients should be referred for surgery.\n\n\nUsually have stenoses in the mid and distal portions of the artery rather than at the ostium or proximal portion (as occurs with atherosclerosis).\n\nShould surgical revascularization become necessary due, for example, to in-stent restenosis, patients may require more complex branch repair to bypass the occluded stent since the stent often covers the renal artery up to the point of the first intrarenal branch.\n\n\nDo we ever place stents?\nTwo situations that may require stenting include dissection or perforation (rare) after angioplasty.\nAnd we’re getting good outcomes with PTA alone?\n\nTechnical (angiographic) success rates for PTA 83-100\nRate of restenosis 12-34% over follow-up intervals of six months to two years\n\nDifficult to determine if patients with FMD develop restenosis, or if the lesion was not completely treated correctly the first time.\nNot necessarily associated with recurrent hypertension.\n\n\nBut generally we can achieve significant and sustained reductions in systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, serum creatinine, and number of antihypertensive agents.\n\nSystolic blood pressure response was better in patients with FMD affecting the main renal artery than in patients with branch vessel involvement.\n\nAny specific technical tips?\n\nCutting balloon angioplasty should be avoided because there is an increased risk of rupture\nPost angioplasty visual inspection alone is not accurate.\n\nMeasure pressure differential using a pressure guidewire, with a mean gradient of <5 mmHg across the treated segment suggesting a satisfactory result\n\nMeasure before and after angioplasty\n\nPost-procedure renal duplex scanning\n\nDegree of turbulence is less prominent, and velocity elevation in the mid-distal renal artery returns to normal.\n\nIntravascular ultrasound (IVUS) or optical coherence tomography (OCT) is occasionally used to evaluate the elimination or reduction of various endoluminal defects.\n\n\nWhat should we do if it doesn’t work?\nIf either has no improvement in blood pressure or an initial improvement followed by recurrence, repeat angiogram and PTA.\n\nRestenosis may actually represent inadequate angioplasty during the first procedure\n\nPersistent HTN despite technically successful PTA suggests that the cause of hypertension is unrelated to fibromuscular disease or is related to small vessel disease within the kidney (nephrosclerosis) due to longstanding hypertension.\nWhat kind of complications do we see after this?\n\nMostly related to vascular access\nRarely: renal artery perforation, dissection, or segmental renal infarction may occur.\nDecreasing over time- 16 % in 1998 to 3 % in 2001\n\n\n\n12.3.3.3 Surgery\nLets switch gears to open revascularization?\nAortorenal bypass with a saphenous vein graft is the most common technique. Artificial graft material used occasionally.\nFor everyone? What about for pediatric patients?\nPediatric patients: hypogastric artery grafts are used or else aortic reimplantation of the renal artery is performed because vein grafts become aneurysmal\nHow does this compare again to PTA?\nSimilar success rates compared to PTA (82-89% patency) but with higher morbidity.\n\nPerioperative mortality appears to be very low (~1.2%)\nUsually limited to complex cases so success and complication would probably be higher if simpler cases were included.\n\nWhat does monitoring and follow-up look like for these patients?\nMedical management only:\n\nRenal artery stenosis and kidney dysfunction may progress despite good blood pressure control\n\nMostly in patients with focal FMD and intimal fibroplasia\n\nEvery patient with FMD should have measurement of serum creatinine and renal artery duplex ultrasound every 12 months.\n\nAfter revascularization:\n\nDuplex ultrasonography and serum creatinine measurements performed on the first office visit post procedure, then every six months for two years, and then yearly, if stable.\nWith worsening on new hypertension, or unexplained increase in the serum creatinine, he or she should be imaged at that time with duplex ultrasound (or CTA if the ultrasound is equivocal or poor quality)."

(Coleman and Stanley 2015)\nVLFDC recently proposed a 3cm threshold for asymptomatic renal artery aneurysm. (Klausner et al. 2015)\nMany aneurysms with circumferential calcification which could offer protection against rupture\n\nIn an elderly patient, observation of this aneurysm with Duplex surveillance is the appropriate treatment.\nFor larger aneurysms in younger patients, aneurysmorrhaphy with primary repair or patching, interposition grafting, or bypass can be performed with low mortality. (Coleman and Stanley 2015)\n\nComparison of ex vivo or insitu renal artery reconstruction have shown no difference in mortality, morbidity, LOS or reoperation.\n\nEndovascular techniques such as coiling have been reported to be successful in treating these saccular aneurysms; however, most aneurysms occur at branch points making covered stent placement difficult. (Coleman and Stanley 2015)\n\nRenal artery dissection caused by guide wires or catheters can occur, but is rare."

    "text": "Your browser does not support the audio tag;  for browser support, please see:  https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_audio.asp \n\n\nWe are going to skip the preoperative workup and description of anatomy and zones of abdominal vascular trauma, so please review this on your own. As a side note, we are also going to skip the management of iliac artery injuries as we covered that as part of our peripheral vascular trauma session.\nScenario: “You have a patient with a gunshot wound to the abdomen. General surgery has already prepped them from the neck to the knees, and performed a laparotomy from the xiphoid to the pubis. They packed the abdomen and temporarily have control. There was note of pulsatile bleeding from Zone I. Can you take us through how to get supraceliac control?\nA case like this should not proceed without close communication of the entire resuscitation team. I would start by making sure that I was on good terms with my anesthesia colleagues. So, they know what we were facing in this situation and that they were pursuing all the key tenets of damage-control resuscitation — leading with blood product or whole blood resuscitation, keeping the patient warm, etc. As far as from a technical standpoint, you can’t sew what you can’t see. So, I immediately assess my exposure — which is the laparotomy. The laparotomy in this case was from the xiphoid to pubis. That’s a great start, but for the approach you have referenced, we will need to come up higher and go between the costal margin and almost begin the first 2 to 3 centimeters of a sternotomy. It is not a sternotomy, but, it comes along the side of the xiphoid to release the inferior costal margins of the thoracic area under the diaphragm to pull the costal margins laterally and up. You want to suspend your costal margins so that you are almost suspending the patient’s rib cage up and away from the aorta and the abdominal contents. So making a good assessment of your exposure initially is really important. In a case that I am prepping and operating on, I try my best to use a retractor. Such as the Omni, that will allow for retractors to be placed underneath the costal margin so one can spread those costal margins and try to lift the thoracic area away from the abdominal contents. If you do not have an Omni retractor, you can still makes sure that you are suspending the superior aspect of your exposure.\nOnce that is done, the other part of communicating with anesthesia is to see if they have a nasogastric tube down. In this case, supraceliac control is almost always facilitated by having a nasogastric tube in the esophagus to allow one to open the esophagus here and be able to get around that esophagus circumferentially — with either umbilical tape or penrose drain. This will allow for appropriate left-sided retraction of the esophagus, away from the crus that is surrounding the aorta.\nThe next maneuver is mobilizing the left lateral segment of the liver, so that it can either be brought cephalad or tucked inferiorly and brought to the right side (or the whole portion of the liver). So now, you have the left lateral segment out of the way. At this point, one is left with the crus that is overlying the aorta.\nThe other maneuver here, dependent upon the situation, is to put the patient in reverse Trendelenburg to let the stomach down and pull it inferiorly so that you create as big a window as you can — with the esophagus retracted to the patient’s left the stomach pulled down. Sometimes, you can have a resident or a an assistant put their hand on the stomach and retract it towards the pelvis.\nNow, you have a window in which you can work. Next is to divide the skeletal muscle, which is the crus overlying the aorta. This can be facilitated with a large right angle and a bovie extender, and hopefully you can feel the aorta with a pulse (even a weak pulse) and divide the crus over the aorta with blunt dissection on either side. Typically, you do not try to spend time to get circumferential control of the aorta. It is not like an elective aneurysm repair where you want to get around the entire aorta. In these cases, if you can get on either side of the aorta down fine, that is what is needed and is most efficient in these emergencies.\nScenario: You enter a patient’s abdomen and there is a large rush of blood. You think it may be coming from somewhere in the upper aorta. Is it worth taking the time to get supraceliac control before doing a medial-visceral rotation and exposing the aorta in that way? Or are there any scenarios in which you do a medial-visceral rotation first before you get supraceliac control? Can you take us through a medial-visceral rotation and pitfalls/advantages of doing each of those approaches, ie when to leave the kidney down and when to take it up?\nIt is worth getting super celiac control if it is a Zone I hematoma, especially if you have some time with someone holding pressure. Now, if you initially believe that the bleeding is from Zone I, but when you are actually able to enter the abdomen it looks like the bleeding is coming from the spleen or a different area, then you can readjust. The left medial-visceral rotation is designed to give optimal exposure of the para-visceral segment of the aorta. The para-visceral segment of the aorta includes the supraceliac segment all the way down to the aortic bifurcation, primarily the left common iliac artery. In this case with the left medial-visceral rotation, it is performed through dividing the white line of Toldt along the sigmoid colon and the left colon. You want to establish this plane in the retroperitonium, which a good portion is achieved through steady blunt dissection facilitated with Bovie electrocautery. In the setting of trauma, this dissection plane is taken from the sigmoid/left colon up to divide the attachments ingrained in the spleen and the left kidney, then to the mid-line and then ultimately to the patient’s right. In the setting of trauma, the left kidney is almost always brought up. It is generally easier and faster, because you do not have to take the time to find the plane above the left kidney.\nCheck out this video for an example of a left medial visceral rotation\nManagement of bleeding from the spleen\nOne of the key tenets of splenic injury is exposure — good retraction with incision up to xiphoid and alongside the left costal margin. Compromised exposure is a contributor to splenic injury.\nWith regard to exposure and eviscerating the bowel, there are some nuances. A method includes finding a moist lap pad that is large enough to cover the bowel, then place a clamp around it with someone holding it outside the abdomen. However, this method may not be as secure and also result in the bowel still being in the way. Do you have any tips on how to eviscerate and control the small bowel?\nThis is difficult to describe, because sometimes you just have to feel it. However, this is the main purview and job of the surgeon that is on the patient’s right. It takes a strong and big right hand, extending as wide as possible, to get the bowel over to the patient’s right side — pulling it from the left to the right. It is not a subtle maneuver. Also, I do not use lap pads. I use an operative towel and ask to moisten the blue towel. You take the blue towel in your left hand and put it underneath your right hand (which has the viscera) to try to get it down to the base and laid out — the blue towel and your right fingers are essentially coming across the aorta passed midline. Then, my preference is to use the Omni retractor to take the place of your right hand, which will come on top of that blue towel and hold all the viscera to the right of patient’s mid-line.\nWith the left medial visceral rotation (Mattox maneuver), we perform the maneuver because of a suspected aortic injury or a close branch off the aorta. However, sometimes we need to do a right medial visceral rotation (Cattell-Braasch maneuver), especially when concerned about an IVC injury. What are some of the nuances of a right medial visceral rotation?\nAs you are on the other side, it still requires dividing the white line of Toldt starting at the cecum and coming along the right colon. You bring the cecum and right colon cephalad and then to the patient’s left. It is actually not so much of a rotation to the midline and then the left, but bringing everything up cephalad and then left to the patient’s left costal margin — almost bringing the cecum and right colon up onto the patient’s left chest. This is a plane that is also similar to the medial visceral rotation on the left side as it is largely developed with blunt dissection. However, it is a combination with opening the retroperitoneum with some Bovie electrocautery. You will also almost immediately see the left iliac vein and then the vena cava. Then, you continue to bring the left colon up until you see the right renal vein and kidney. At the superior extent, this will expose the head of the pancreas and duodenum. And similarly, you use a blue operative towel to cover and bring up the viscera to be held with the large retractors so your hands are free to operate. Spine exposures with orthopedic and neurosurgical colleagues and transplant procurements are also a great opportunity to learn the tenets of rotating the viscera either right or left and exposing the retroperitoneum.\nCheck out this video for an example of a right medial visceral rotation.\nTechnique for exposure of the Infrarenal Aorta\nThe exposure of the infrarenal aorta is also called the transperitoneal inframesocolic exposure and is considered to be a straightforward maneuver. Inframesocolic means that the transverse colon is reflected cephalad. One of the first aspects of this maneuver is to hold up the transverse colon and drape it up cephalad to patient’s costal margin (can be held up with a blue towel and retractor). Next, you divide the ligament of Treitz (by the surgeon on the patient’s right) and get down to the fourth portion of the duodenum which should be to the left of patient’s midline. Once divided, the left colon remains on the patient’s left and everything else goes to patient’s right. However, this is not a medial visceral rotation because only the fourth portion of the duodenum and all of the small bowel is partitioned to patient’s right. At this point, one should see the infrarenal aorta. The left renal vein is the most cephalad extent and the aortic bifurcation is the most caudal extent (located at root of colon mesentery). The left renal vein can be ligated if necessary to facilitate aortic control. However, it is best to try to preserve the branches of the left renal vein that drain the left kidney (gonadal and lumbar) so that dividing the left renal vein is not as much of a detriment to the kidney.\nTips for getting umbilical tape or vessel loop around aorta, especially in supraceliac region.\nYou can achieve this with a combination of Metzenbaum scissors and controlled pressure. You are trying to free the aorta from the connective tissue around it to get back to the spine. You can use a metallic pediatric yankauer (small profile and blunt tip) as a dissection tool and push with the Metzenbaum scissors along with direct feel to get the aorta freed. Then, you can use a right angle to get underneath the aorta. You also want to make sure to identify the lumbar vessels — “find the outside before you find the inside” — so you can clip them with medium/large Weck clips.\nTechniques of exposing and repairing branches off of aorta: Celiac Artery\nThe origin of the celiac artery can be seen with left medial visceral rotation as it will show the entire paravisceral segment of the aorta and also with an anterior approach through the lesser sac (very similar to exposure needed for the supraceliac aortic exposure). The stomach is retracted caudally towards the pelvis, lesser sac is opened, and then the stomach is pulled down further. The pancreas is pulled down as well and the origin of the first centimeter of the celiac artery is now exposed. For injuries to the proximal portions of the celiac, if able to be repaired primarily — use 4-0 or 5-0 prolene sutures. If injury is large and there is destruction of vessel wall, then primary repair is not an option and this becomes a damage-control situation to control the bleeding. With damage control, ligation is even considered as an initial step to save a patient’s life.\nTechniques of exposing and repairing branches off of aorta: Common Hepatic Artery\nThe common hepatic artery is best visualized through that similar transperitoneal anterior approach for exposure of the celiac artery through the lesser sac. Prior to identifying the common hepatic, you have to find the celiac and follow the branches. Patient should be in reverse Trendelenberg, the stomach inferior, and costal margins flared up to have the appropriate space. This will expose the second and third portions of the celiac artery, and its major branches — including the common hepatic. The common hepatic artery can not be visualized using left medial visceral rotation. Primary repair is ideal, however, in damage control surgery ligation may be the only choice. If possible, ligation of the common hepatic proximal to the GDA is preferable as there will be retrograde flow from the GDA into the proper hepatic to maintain the viability of the duodenum, pancreas, and liver.\nTechniques of exposing and repairing branches off of aorta: Gastroduodenal Artery (GDA)\nThe gastroduodenal artery is the first branch off of the common hepatic artery and defines the junction between the common and proper hepatic arteries. Primary repair should be sought if possible. If it is a damage control situation, then the GDA must be ligated to control hemorrhage. If ligated, assess patient’s condition, resuscitate, utilize the doppler, and assess the area distal to ligation to evaluate the consequences. For example, if ligation showed appropriate collaterals, then the vessel can remain ligated. However, if there is clear ischemia, then there is a difficult decision between repair vs. shunt vs. permanent ligation along with its metabolic consequences. The decision is dependent on each situation. The principles of damage control resuscitation and damage control surgery should always be maintained.\nTechniques of exposing and repairing branches off of aorta: Superior Mesenteric Artery (SMA)\nThe SMA is divided into segments based on its course, from aorta to pancreas to root of mesentery to the small bowel. Approach to SMA visualization is dependent on the segment that needs to be exposed. The first segments of the SMA can be seen through left medial visceral rotation. The distal segments of the SMA can be seen through the anterior transperitoneal approach. Since the SMA (second segment) is near the head of the pancreas, if the proximal segment of the SMA is injured, then the head of the pancreas may need to be divided to get appropriate exposure. If the segment of the SMA that is injured is distal to the pancreas, then it can be visualized through the inframesocolic approach. With regards to ligation, distal SMA segments will be more tolerant of ligation. All efforts should be made to mantain flow through the SMA. Primary repair can be performed on small injuries with 4-0 or 5-0 prolene suturing. Larger injuries can be repaired with patch angioplasty or interposition graft (PTFE, Dacron, or autologous tissue such as proximal greater saphenous vein or deep femoral vein). Autologous vein is preferred in contaminated field, but can also use rifampin-soaked Dacron. Tunneling is dependent on location, proximal segments would need 6-8 mm of graft while distal segments would need 3-4 mm. It is important to remember that a majority of these axial injuries are typically unsurvivable and proximal SMA repair is uncommon in the trauma setting. Even if the SMA is repaired and the bowel appears viable, it is preferred to delay abdominal closure and perform a second look 24-36 hours later or sooner depending on the patient’s condition.\nTechniques of exposing and repairing branches off of aorta: Inferior Mesenteric Artery (IMA)\nThe majority of times, the IMA can be ligated. Prior to ligation, assess the patency of the iliac vessels — specifically the internal iliac vessels. Also, if both celiac and SMA are patent, then the IMA ligation can be tolerated. If there is concern for atherosclerotic disease or occlusion in the internal iliacs, then ligation may not be the preferred option and re-implantation may be considered.\nTechniques of exposing and repairing branches off of aorta: Renal Arteries\nIt is important to consider the broad principles and approach:\n\nUrgency of situation\nOptimal Exposure\nResuscitation Efforts\nCommunication with Team\nAppropriate Equipment\n\nDecision to maintain patency of a vessel vs. ligation is dependent upon the situation. During damage-control procedures where bleeding is not controlled and location of hemorrhage not known, the inclination is to ligate. The risk is organ ischemia, but the benefit would be patient survival.\nThe renal artery is similar to the SMA, unlikely to be reconstructed in a trauma setting. In renal trauma, the renal artery is either not injured (with only injury to renal parenchyma) or renal artery is injured and thrombosed. If renal artery is injured and thrombosed, salvageability is unlikely due to prolonged warm ischemic time of the kidney. Repair of the renal artery would truly occur if there is an expanding hematoma in Zone II that warranted exploration and it was found that the source of the hemorrhage was from an injured renal artery that still has flow. In this case, again, would do primary repair with smaller injuries with a 4-0, 5-0, or even 6-0 monofilament prolene suture. If a primary repair would compromise the lumen, then consider patch angioplasty. However, most commonly, if renal artery is injured it is ligated for damage-control. With regard to incidental CT findings, an intimal flap , fistula, and/or possible pseudoaneurysm of the renal artery, the injury can be observed if there is continued renal perfusion and no flow limitation. If it is a flow limiting injury with more than 50% stenosis caused by the intimal flap, it may be amenable to endovascular placement of bare metal stent to tack down the flap. Distal branch artery injuries can also be managed with endovascular coil embolization. Again, the decision to take the time to coil embolize is dependent on the patient’s current hemodynamics. Most commonly, if there is an expanding hematoma in Zone II and the renal artery/parenchyma is damaged and confirmed as source of hemorrhage, a nephrectomy is warranted and there is no indication for repair.\nGeneral Guidelines of Penetrating vs. Blunt Retroperitoneal Exploration\nZone I hematomas: explore whether penetrating or blunt mechanism.\nZone II hematomas: always explore if penetrating, do not explore during blunt unless expanding. Kidneys are in Zone II and are in the lateral gutters.\nZone III hematomas: always explore if penetrating, do not explore during blunt unless expanding."

    "text": "15.1 Pathogenesis of peripheral arterial disease\nWhat is Peripheral Artery Occlusive Disease (PAD)?\nPeripheral Arterial Disease encompasses extremity arterial disease but generally is used to describe lower limb arterial occlusive disease. Peripheral Artery Occlusive Disease (PAD) is a more specific term and this encompasses atherosclerotic disease of the lower limb arteries.\nThe disease has a step-wise spectrum of presentations from asymptomatic disease to intermittent claudication and finally chronic limb threatening ischemia (CLTI) formerly known as Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) (Aboyans et al. 2018)\nWhat is the underlying pathophysiology of PAD?\nThe understanding of the underlying pathophysiology which results in occlusive arterial disease of the lower limb has evolved over the last 50 years. Atherosclerosis remains the main pathological process resulting in occlusive disease with smoking being the primary modifiable risk factor.\nAlthough with the rising incidence of diabetes a second population of patients with a significant PAD burden has developed.\nAtherosclerosis begins with an injury to the intimal lining of the arterial wall, which, for example, can result from smoking, hypertension, hyperglycemia, or advanced age. Repeated injury leads to a chronic inflammatory process resulting in the uptake and oxidation of LDL, resulting in foam cells.(Hiltunen et al. 1998; Tsimikas et al. 2005; Witztum 1994) Foam cells result when unregulated scavenger receptors promote uptake of oxidized LDL by macrophages and smooth muscle cells. These foam cells become necrotic and then create the central core of the atheroma.(Owens 2019) This oxidized LDL form into intimal plaque, build up and calcification that may result in progressive vessel stenosis and subsequent occlusion, or plaque rupture with acute occlusion.\nAtherosclerosis is particularly prone to developing at sites of arterial bifurcation (i.e. carotid bifurcation, femoral bifurcation) because turbulent flow and low laminar shear stress results in the down regulation of eNOS and NO production. This in turn increases V-CAM-1 and reduces inhibition of KF-kB (resulting in it’s elevation.(Owens 2019)\n\nAHA lesion classification - defines plaque risk for rupture/thrombosis. Extrapolated from the coronary artery disease literature.(McGill et al. 2000)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClassification\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n0\nNormal artery\n\n\n1\nInitial atherosclerotic lesion\n\n\n2\nFatty streak\n\n\n3\nFatty plaque/raised fatty streak\n\n\n4\nAtheroma\n\n\n5\nFibroatheroma - development of fibrotic cap, vascularization or calcium\n\n\n6\nComplicated lesion\n\n\n\nWhat are the risk factors for atherosclerosis?\nModifiable:\n\nSmoking\n\nThe most significant modifiable risk factor for developing peripheral arterial disease.\nCauses endothelial dysfunction by reducing nitric oxide and triggering reactive-oxygen species, platelet adhesion, and permeability of endothelial surface to fibrinogen.(United States Surgeon General 2014; Hackam and Anand 2003).\nCauses a prothrombotic environment by causing an increase in thromboxane A2 and decreasing prostacyclin thus overall resulting in increased prothrombotic environment for platelets.\nSmoking has a stronger association with Intermittent claudication than with Coronary Artery Disease! (Gordon and Kannel 1972)\n\nDiabetes, Metabolic Syndrome, and Insulin Resistance\n\nDiabetes Mellitus, after smoking, is the most significant modifiable risk factor for developing peripheral arterial disease. Both insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia are independent risk factors for developing peripheral arterial disease.\nThe Odds Risk for developing PAD in patients with DM ranges from 1.89 to 4.05.\nFactors associated with developing PAD in diabetics include female gender, chronicity/severity of DM, insulin dependence, African American race or Hispanic ethnicity.(Regensteiner et al. 2015; Selvin et al. 2006; Wattanakit et al. 2005) An increase in HbA1C by 1% correlates with a 28% increase risk of developing PAD. (Amanda I. Adler et al. 2002)\nThe following mechanisms may lead to PAD in diabetics\n\nHyperglycemia reduces bioavailability of NO, which is a vasodilator, enhances endothelial function, and inhibits both platelet activation and smooth muscle migration.(Higashi et al. 2009)\nHyperglycemia activates protein kinase C and thus accumulation of mitochondrial ROS and prostanoids.(Geraldes and King 2010)\nEndothelial dysfunction leads to increased endothelin-1 and vasoconstriction.(Ahlborg et al. 2007)\n\n\nHypertension\n\nThe most common cardiovascular risk factor worldwide.\n\nUSPSTF Grade A recommendation for HTN screening confirm readings outside clinical setting or at home before initiating treatment.(Piper et al. 2014)\n\nThe Incidence of PAD increases to 2.5-fold in patients with Hypertension. (Kannel and McGee 1985)\nEach 20mg increase in BP, results in a 35-63% increase risk in PAD. Recommend keeping BP <140/90 or <130/80 in diabetics or CKD.(A. I. Adler et al. 2000; Bavry et al. 2010; Emdin et al. 2015; Itoga et al. 2018)\n\nDyslipidemia\n\nA strong association has long been identified as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.(Langlois and Nordestgaard 2018; Diehm et al. 2004)\n25% cardiovascular event reduction for each 39 mg/dL (1mmol/L) reduction in LDL. (H. P. S. C. Group 2007)\nJUPITER Study - Randomized rosuvastatin 20mg to placebo in healthy patients. Found significant decrease in unstable angina, myocardial infarction and stroke. However, patients had a higher incidence of physician-reported diabetes, but no difference in myopathy.(Ridker et al. 2008)\nFish oil is also indicated for secondary prevention among patients with known cardiovascular disease.(Grenon et al. 2012; Kris-Etherton et al. 2002; Siscovick et al. 2017)\n\n\nNon-Modifiable:\n\nAge\n\nAge is identified as a risk factor for PAD regardless of gender.\nPrevalence of PAD increases with age: 15% > 70 years of age.\n\nGender\n\nThe Framingham Study has found that the risk of developing PAD is doubled in men.\n\nRace and Ethnicity\n\nThe MESA study showed a higher prevalence of PAD (ABPI <0.9) in African Americans compared to Whites. 7.2% versus 3.6%. (Bild 2002)\nCross Sectional analysis 6653 subjects all with ABPI assessment revealed a prevalence of PAD (<0.9) of 4%. Non-Hispanic Whites: 3.6%, Asian: 2%, African American: 7.2% and Hispanic: 2.4%. (p<0.01) (Allison et al. 2006)\n\n\nWhat are the some of the major population-based trials looking at the natural history of atherosclerotic disease?\n\nThe Framingham Heart Study: The original Cohort from the town of Framingham, n=5183 patients, followed over time for over 30 years. There have been multiple subsequent recruited populations since. The majority of information we have about risk factors related to cardiovascular health comes from this study. (Mahmood et al. 2014)\nThe Rotterdam Study: 1990, Longitudinal Study, >7000 participants.\nCVHS: 1989-1999 Longitudinal Study : n>5000 Multicenter Study.\nMESA: Cross Sectional analysis 6653 subjects all with ABPI assessment revealed a prevalence of PAD (<0.9) of 4%. Non-Hispanic Whites: 3.6%, Asian: 2%, African American: 7.2% and Hispanic: 2.4%. (p<0.01) (Allison et al. 2006)\nThe Edinburgh Study: The EAS began as a cross sectional study of 1592 men and women in Edinburgh with the goal of examining the frequency of risk factors for peripheral arterial disease. The subjects were followed over 20 years. (F. G. R. Fowkes et al. 1991)\n\nHow does Diabetes confound the clinical picture of PAD?\n\nIncreasing Incidence of Diabetes world-wide.(Boulton et al. 2005)\n\n2.8% of the global population affected by diabetes in 2000, estimated to be 4.4% by 2030.\n25% of patients with diabetes develop a diabetic foot ulcer (DFU), at some stage in their lives.\nDiabetic foot ulcers have a very high rate of recurrence with 40% of patients developing a new ulcer within 12 months of healing a previous ulcer. (D. G. Armstrong, Boulton, and Bus 2017)\nLimb Loss occurs every 20 seconds world-wide to due to Diabetes related PAD or infection.\n\n\nWhat’s the pathophysiology of Diabetes and PAD (D. L. Armstrong et al. 2012)\n\nNeuropathy. The loss of the basic nociceptive mechanisms in the foot among diabetics, presents as a loss of protective sensation (LOPS). Neuropathy can be divided into three types:\n\nSensory: “stocking-glove” distribution\nMotor: Intrinsic muscle wasting – resulting in deformities\nAutonomic: Sympathetic nervous system pathology\n\nStructural deformities and gait disturbances\nArterial disease of large and small vessels.\n\nLarge Vessel\nSmall Vessel\nBoth\n\nFoot infection(Bandyk 2018; KAYSSI, ROGERS, and NEVILLE 2019; Lepäntalo et al. 2011)\n\nGiven the pathological effect of diabetes upon multiple structures and systems the normal progressive history of diabetes related PAD is somewhat different to smoking related PAD. Clinically due to the combined effect of peripheral neuropathy and microvascular arterial disease, foot ulceration for many patients tends to be the initial presentation. This results in a lack of a ‘safety net’ where presenting with progressive claudication allows for a period of detection, management and and risk factor modification before they develop tissue loss and are at risk of amputation, leading to poor outcomes and greater morbidity and mortality.\nSince the publication of WIfI in 2014 a lot has changed in the way we view PAD leading up to last years new Global Vascular Guidelines on CLTI, which as a term has replaced CLI (see Chapter 16).

    "text": "15.2 Intermittent Claudication\nWhat is Intermittent Claudication and the classic patient presentation?\nThe original population studies we mentioned determined the epidemiology and natural history of Intermittent Claudication based on historically validated and widely accepted questionnaires, namely the Rose (Rose 1962) (which later was adopted by the WHO) and subsequently the Edinburgh questionnaire. (Lend and Fowkes 1992).\nAll questionnaires are based on a number of key diagnostic clinical factors that define claudication, they are:\n\nOnset\nCalf Involvement\nReproducibility\nRelief with Rest\nNot Occurring at Rest\n\nThe progression of intermittent claudication was historically graded by Fontaine (1954) (Fontaine, Kim, and Kieny 1954) followed by the Rutherford Grading System (1986, Revised 1997) (Rutherford et al. 1997)\nRutherford et al. Ad Hoc Committee on Reporting Standards, SVS/North American Chapter ISCVS:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrade\nCategory\nClinical Description\n\n\n\n\n0\n0\nA symptomatic - no hemodynamic significant occlusive disease\n\n\nI\n1\nMild Claudication\n\n\nI\n2\nModerate Claudication\n\n\nI\n3\nSevere Claudication\n\n\nII\n4\nIschemic Rest Pain\n\n\nIII\n5\nMinor Tissue Loss\n\n\nIII\n6\nMajor Tissue Loss\n\n\n\nLeriche Syndrome - Is a clinical triad of: claudication (buttock, thigh, and calf), impotence, and decreased lower limb pulses, which signifies aortoiliac occlusive disease. (Frederick, Newman, and Kohlwes 2010; Leriche and Morel 1948; Setacci et al. 2012)\nNeurogenic Claudication - Differentiating neurogenic claudication from vasculogenic claudication can be difficult. Vasculogenic claudication is relieved by cessation of ambulation and mostly affects a unilateral calf. Neurogenic improves with postural changes, more often bilateral and affects the thighs. (Nadeau et al. 2013)\nWhat is involved in the work up of patients with PAD/Intermittent Claudication?\n\n15.2.1 History / Clinical Examination\nSVS Guidelines:\n“We recommend using ABPI as the first-line non-invasive test to establish a diagnosis of PAD in individuals with symptoms or signs suggestive of disease. When the ABI is borderline or normal (>0.9) and symptoms of claudication are suggestive, we recommend an exercise ABPI.”\nGrade 1 Level of Evidence A\n\nABPI\nExercise ABPI\nUltrasound\n\nWhat is an ABPI and how is it measured?\nThe AHA released guidelines on how to perform an ABPI in an attempt to standardize the method to allow for more comparable results from studies:\nDivide the higher of the PT or DP pressure by the higher of the right or left Brachial SBP (Class 1 Level of Evidence A) (Aboyans et al. 2012)\nSensitivity and Specificity both >95% (when ABPI cut off </=0.9 – in detecting >/= 50% stenosis) (Yao, Hobbs, and Irivne 2005; Ouriel et al. 1982)\n\nInterpretation of ABPIs.\n\n\nABPI\nInterpretation\n\n\n\n\n>1.4\nNon-compressible\n\n\n>0.9-1.39\nNormal\n\n\n0.5-0.9\nMild to Mod PAD\n\n\n0.0-0.5\nSevere PAD\n\n\n\nWhat are Exercise ABPI studies?\nConstant Load Testing – (unlike the Graded Test – Bruce Protocol).\nThe physiological changes in ABPI related to exercise are due to the fact that exercise increases SBP and decreases SVR and, therefore, will affect flow through a stenosis making it more physiologically relevant during exercise. (Nicolaï et al. 2009; Alqahtani et al. 2018)\nWalking distance has been shown to correlate with level and severity of POAD. (Strandness and Sumner 1975)\nFurthermore patients with single level iliac disease may present with buttock/thigh claudication with preserved pulses. Exercise treadmill ABPI particularly useful in determining the severity of disease in these patients.

Vascular Laboratory: Arterial Duplex Scanning. Rutherford’s Vascular Surgery and Endovascular Therapy. 2019.(Stone and Hass 2019)\nWhat Guidelines are there pertaining to PAD Management.\nSVS Guidelines (2015)\n\nThe SVS published the SVS practice guidelines for atherosclerotic occlusive disease of the lower extremities:Management of asymptomatic disease and claudication. Conte and Pomposelli et al. JVS 2015 (Conte, Pomposelli, Clair, Geraghty, McKinsey, Mills, Moneta, Murad, Powell, Reed, Schanzer, et al. 2015)\n\nOther Guidelines:\n\nTASC 1 -2\nEuropean Guidelines (2017)\nAHA Guidelines (last update 2016)\n\n\n\n15.2.2 Management\n\n15.2.2.1 Medical Management\nWhat is the initial management of Asymptomatic Patients with PAD?\n\nSmoking Cessation – Multidisciplinary comprehensive smoking cessation interventions – repeatedly until tobacco use has stopped (Grade A – 1)\nIntervention is not only not recommended, but invasive treatment is recommended against, in the absence of symptoms (Grade A -1)\n\nHow can we medically manage asymptomatic PAD based on the SVS Guidelines?\n\nAnti-Platelet Therapy\n\nThe Aspirin for Asymptomatic Atherosclerosis Trial – n=3350, aspirin versus placebo. 8 years follow up no difference in events (F. Gerald R. Fowkes 2010) – therefore benefit unknown\nLiterature reviews find benefits in secondary prevention with antiplatelet monotherapy (aspirin or clopidogrel) in symptomatic PAD.(Banerjee et al. 2015) Some initial studies did demonstrate benefit from vorapaxar as well.(Rooke et al. 2013)\n\nStatin Therapy\n\nThe Heart Protection Study (H. P. S. C. Group 2007) - this study looked at statins in patients with PAD but not completely asymptomatic, they had other risk factors such as diabetes, IHD, cerebrovascular disease, or hypertension. Without these risk factors the benefit of Statin therapy remains unclear.\nHowever, the AHA from the Framingham Study does recommend using statins if 10-year risk based on risk calculators >7.5% (which would be positive if PAD present).\nStatins are particularly useful for risk reduction of cardiovascular events in diabetics.(Collaborators et al. 2008; Colhoun et al. 2004; Stamler et al. 1993)\nStatin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) is the most common side effect and occurrence has been reported as high as 30% in some cohorts.(Keen et al. 2014) Other side effects are rare (1.5-5% of patients) and include DM2 new onset, neurocognitive effects, hepatotoxicity, renal toxicity and pancreatitis.(Bitzur et al. 2013; Saxon and Eckel 2016; Ward, Watts, and Eckel 2019)\n\nExercise and Limb Function\n\nNo clear evidence that physical therapy improves the patient outcomes or quality of life.\n\nSurveillance\n\nNo benefit from US surveillance, unclear benefit of ABPI surveillance.\nPatients are at higher risk of depression (almost 20%), therefore PHQ-9 and -2 are good screening tools.(Jha et al. 2019; McDermott et al. 2016; Ramirez, Drudi, and Grenon 2018)\n\n\nHow can we medically manage Intermittent Claudication based on the SVS Guidelines?\n\nSmoking Cessation: Multidisciplinary comprehensive smoking cessation interventions – repeatedly until tobacco use has stopped (Grade A – 1) First line therapy is behavioral therapy + varenicline/bupropion or nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) per EAGLES trial.(Anthenelli et al. 2016; Vogeler, McClain, and Evoy 2016)\n\nPreloading with varenicline (4 weeks) or bupropion (5-7d) prior to quitting has demonstrated higher abstinence at 12w.(Ratchford and Black 2011)\n\nVarenicline is a partial nicotine receptor agonist.(Cahill et al. 2016)\nBupropion is a selective dopamine and norepinephrine uptake inhibitor.(Hughes et al. 2014)\n\nNRT is preferred if rapid onset of action is needed.(Thomsen, Villebro, and Møller 2014) However, contraindicated in setting of recent MI, severe angina, or life threatening arrhythmias.\n\nDyslipidaemia: Statin Therapy Recommended – most recent evidence on lipid therapy has suggested focusing on reducing 10-year cardiovascular event risk rather than specifically reducing lipid levels. (Grade 1-A)\nAnti-Platelet Therapy: Aspirin therapy (75-325mg daily) is recommended to reduce cardiovascular events in patients with PAD (Grade 1-Level A) (Antithrombotic Trialists’Collaboration 2002; Antithrombotic Trialists’(ATT) Collaboration et al. 2009)\n\nThere is evidence that Clopidogrel 75mg compared to Aspirin is better in event reduction. (CAPRIE)(Committee 1996)– replacing Aspirin with Clopidogrel (Grade 1-Level B)\nRecent evidence from the COMPASS trial has suggested that the addition of low dose rivaroxaban (2.5mg BID) to aspirin (100mg daily) has lower MALE, composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, stroke and MI. Subgroup analysis suggested clopidogrel may be better with reduced risk of GI bleed and MACE.(Anand et al. 2018; Eikelboom et al. 2017)\n\nDiabetes Mellitus: – Optimization of HbA1C < 7% (Grade 1-Level B)(Lajoie 2019)\nHypertension – Indicated B-Blockers for hypertension. (Grade 1-Level B) (there’s no evidence that Beta Blockers worsens IC)\n\nInitiation of beta-blockers in the immediate preoperative period is associated with worse outcomes.(Blessberger et al. 2018; P. S. Group et al. 2008)\nACE Inhibitors are first line in patients with heart failure, diabetes or kidney disease but should be avoided in patients with renal artery stenosis (RAS).(Barrons and Woods 2016)\n\nHomocysteine – Recommendation against Folic Acid and Vit B12(Grade 2 – C)\n\nHigher homocysteine levels are associated with PAD and risk of venous and arterial thrombosis.(D’Angelo and Selhub 1997; Khandanpour et al. 2009; Liebman 2019)\n\n\nTo improve Limb Function in patients with IC:\n\nCilostozol use – IC without CHF – 3-month Trial (Grade 2 - A)\n\nIf unable to tolerate Cilostozol – Pentoxifylline (400mg TDS) (Grade 2 – B)\nBased on Meta-analysis 26 trials (Stevens et al. 2012)\n\nSupervised Exercise Therapy\n\nFirst Line Therapy recommended SEP: minimum three times / week (30-60 min/session) for at least 12 weeks (Grade 1 Level A)\nMore durable functional improvements than angioplasty alone, however no current data demonstrating impact on need for revascularization or amputation rate.(F. Fakhry et al. 2013; Farzin Fakhry et al. 2015; Murphy et al. 2012, 2015)\nMeta-analysis of 32 RCTs: Placebo versus exercise: Walking Time, Walking Ability, Pain Free Walking and maximum walking distance improves. BUT no difference in ABPI, Mortality or amputation. (Lane et al. 2017)\nMeta-analysis of 14 RCTs: SEP better than Non-Supervised Programs. (Hageman et al. 2018)\n\n\n\n\n15.2.2.2 Open and Endovascular Management\nWhat is the surgical management for patients with Intermittent Claudication?\n\nWith appropriate medical management and risk modification, 25% of patients will improve, 50% will remain stable and 25% will progress and requiring intervention. (Conte, Pomposelli, Clair, Geraghty, McKinsey, Mills, Moneta, Murad, Powell, Reed, and al. 2015; Norgren et al. 2007)\nPatient Selection for Intervention:\n\n20-30% of patients with IC who adhere to risk factor modification will have progressive symptoms that will eventually be treated with intervention.\nPatient selection should be based on QoL and functional impairment in an active person (loss of ability to perform occupation or that limits basic activities of daily living) rather than hemodynamic (ABPI or US) or anatomical disease progression/severity.\n\nAlways remember multifactorial causes of immobility – particularly in the elderly.\n\nSVS recommends that invasive therapy for IC have a >50% likelihood of sustained clinical improvement for at least 2 years.\n\nAnatomical Selection:\n\nAortoiliac Disease:\n\nPrevious TASC Classification has attempted to categorize anatomy of disease and subsequent recommendation of Endovascular versus open surgery. But as the authors of the SVS guidelines highlight, “improvements in technology and endovascular techniques have resulted in EVT replacing open surgical bypass as a primary treatment for both focal and advanced AIOD in many cases.”\nThe majority of evidence is non randomized and meta analyses of non-randomized series.\nEndovascular procedures over open surgery for focal AIOD causing IC. (Grade 1 Evidence B)\nEndovascular interventions as first line for CIA or EIZ occlusive disease-causing IC. (Grade 1 Level B)\nHybrid recommended for Iliac disease involving CFA. (Grade 1 Level B)\nDirect Surgical reconstruction (bypass, endarterectomy) in patients with reasonable surgical risk and diffuse AIOD not amenable to endovascular approach, after one or more failed attempts at EVT, or combined occlusive and aneurysmal disease. (Grade 1 Evidence B)\n\nInfrainguinal Disease:\n\nReviewing historical data comparing all EVT compared with surgical bypass EVTs are less durable, especially when there’s diffuse or long segments of occlusion/multilevel infrainguinal disease.\nMost recommendations are based on low level evidence when comparing EVT versus Open Surgery\nFocal + Not involving SFA origin = EVT (Grade 1 Level C)\nSFA 5-15cm, self-expanding stent (with or without paclitaxel) (Grade 1 Level B) – NB: (This was in 2015 pre Katsanos Paper(Katsanos et al. 2018))\n\nAfter SFA stenting, SVS and ACC recommend at least 30d dual anti-platelet, then single anti-platelet or anti-platelet and rivaroxaban.(Hussain et al. 2018; Vascular Surgery Lower Extremity Guidelines Writing Group et al. 2015; Strobl et al. 2013; Tepe et al. 2012)\n\nRecommend against infrapopliteal treatment for IC (Grade 1 Level C)\nInitial Surgical Bypass (with vein: Grade 1 Level A): If\n\nDiffuse FP Disease\nSmall Caliber <5mm\nExtensive Calcification in SFA\nAverage or Low Operative Risk (Grade 1 Level B)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAboyans, Victor, Michael H.

The GVG mentions that their “promotion” of the term CLTI is partly due to terms such as “critical or severe limb ischemia” failing to “recognize the full spectrum and inter-relatedness of components beyond ischemia that contribute to major limb amputation…”\nWhat was the original definition and threshold for CLI, and how can we make sure we elicit the right symptoms from the patient?\nJohn Cranley back in his publication in 1969 defined Ischemic Rest Pain as,\n“…pain that occurs in the toes or in the area of the metatarsal heads. Occasionally…in the foot proximal to the metatarsal heads. Elevation of the limb above or at the horizontal position aggravates the pain and pendency…brings relief…” (Cranley 1969)\nNocturnal Rest Pain: Worse due to horizontal positioning (no gravitational assistance) and systolic BP drop during sleep."

    "section": "16.2 Evaluation",
    "text": "16.2 Evaluation\nWhat aspects of the clinical assessment is important?\nClinical Assessment involves a full history (the differential mentioned in Intermittent Claudication) and examination.\n\nClinical Examination:\n\nBuergers Test (Beurger 1908) / AKA Ratschows Test (Max-Ratschow-Klinic) identifies when there is critical ischemia without necrosis yet or gangrene, and is characterized by pallor when the leg is elevated above the level of the heart, which then turns red when hanging down over the edge of the bed. This redness is referred to as “Sunset appearance” and its due to abnormal autoregulation. Its been described that normally only a third of the capillary bed is open at any time but in a state of critical ischemia because of the autoregulation being paralyzed a significantly higher portion of the capillaries open up.\nThe ischemic Angle: A refinement to Berger’s Test: The angle of elevation from the horizontal at which the Doppler Signal of the PT or DP disappears. This is also referred to as the ‘pole test’, whereby the foot is raised alongside a calibrated pole marked in mmHg.\n\nTissue Loss:\n\nGangrene Dry or Wet (infection)\nLevel of tissue Loss\nProbing To Bone/ Exposed structures: Tendons, Soft Tissue, bone, Joint Capsule.\nExamination of an Ulcer (may have many etiologies) – important not only to identify extent of disease but also to exclude other etiologies:\n\nSuch as venous, mixed, infective, autoimmune, inflammatory, malignancy or trauma.\n\n\nFoot Infection - Signs of infection, erythema, rubor, cellulitis, tenderness or unexplained hyperglycemia in diabetic patients should prompt urgent referral.(Kalish and Hamdan 2010)\n\nWhat is the natural history of CLTI and what do we know about its prognosis?\nFortunately, only a small portion of patients with Intermittent Claudication will go on to develop rest pain or tissue loss. Its estimated that anywhere between 5% -29% of patients with PAD or IC go on to develop CLTI over 5 years.\nHowever, those that do develop CLTI, have a high risk of limb loss (greater than 20% annual risk).\nCLTI measurements most predictive of non-healing are ankle pressure <50mmHg, ABI <0.4, TcPO2 <20mmHg, and TP <20mmHg.(Gerhard-Herman et al. 2017; Wickström et al. 2017)\nPatients with CLTI have a high mortality risk (10-15% annual risk), the majority of terminal events being related to cardiovascular events. Limb loss or mortality may reach as high as 50% in 1 year. (Adam et al. 2005; Norgren et al. 2007)\nWhat has changed in the last few decades?\nEtiologically the prevalence of smokers(Ex and Current) in the population has decreased and the prevalence of diabetes has increased.\nWhat is the WIFI Classification? (Mills et al. 2014)\nInterestingly in the original article by Bob Rutherford regarding Diabetes and PAD:\n- “It was generally agreed that diabetic patients who have a varied clinical picture of neuropathy, ischemia and sepsis make the definition even more difficult and it is desirable that these patients be excluded…diabetic patients should be clearly defined as a separate category or should be clearly defined as a separate category.”\nSince then, the SVS, while acknowledging that we can no longer exclude these patients and treat them separately given the overlap, have decided that a new classification system is necessary, as one of the key authors (Joseph Mills) states:\n\n“We classify things into groups to differentiate, remember and compare, observe and predict their behavior over time.” –Joseph Mills\n\nWIfI stands for: Wound, Ischemia and foot Infection. Most of the existing Vascular and non-Vascular classification systems don’t include all three components or fail to stratify the degree of ischemia and presence of gangrene.\nPrinciples of WIfI:\n\nGrades, Classes and Stages – Each of the three categories (WIfI) have Grades 0,1,2,3: Resulting in 64 Classes.\nDelphi Consensus – Clinical Stages 1 (Very Low),2 (Low), 3 (Moderate), 4 (High Risk/Benefit).\n\nWhat is the one-year risk of amputation with medical therapy alone?\nWhat is the potential benefit from successful revascularization?\nAnalogous to TNM Staging\n\n\n“It is intended to be an iterative process with the goal of more precisely stratifying patients according to their initial disease burden, analogous to TNM cancer staging, but not to dictate therapy.”\nWhat about a differential diagnosis or other causes of similar pain as rest pain?\nAcute lower limb ischemia has a different clinical presentation, but there may some overlap with Acute on Chronic disease such as in the case of in situ thrombosis in the lower limb arterial system.\nOther causes of ischemic pain include:\n\nBuergers Disease, or Thromboangiitis Obliterans - for more see Section 3.3.4\nScleroderma\nFibromuscular Dysplasia\nPopliteal Artery Entrapment\nCystic Adventitial Disease\nPersistent Sciatic Artery Disease\n\nWhat is the Rutherford Acute Ischemia Grading System?\nAlthough acute ischemia is very different from chronic ischemia, patients with progressive chronic PAD can develop an acute picture whether from embolism or in-situ thrombosis secondary to plaque rupture. See Chapter 17 for more.\nWhat are the current CLTI Guidelines?\nIn 2019 the SVS, the ESVS and the World federation of Vascular Societies (WFVS) joined forces to put together the structure and funding of the Global Vascular Guidelines Initiative (GVG). Importantly all sponsorship was directly from the societies and any direct industry sponsorship or external sources were excluded. They put together a steering committee responsible for recruiting a large and diverse writing group and outlined the scope and developed the section briefs of the guideline.\nThey determined that:\n\n“The term”critical limb ischemia” (CLI) is outdated and fails to encompass the full spectrum of patients who are evaluated and treated for limb-threatening ischemia in modern practice.”\nCLTI was promoted as the term of choice and was defined by the target population.\nThe target population were:\n\nIschemic Rest Pain with confirmatory hemodynamic studies.\nDiabetic Foot Ulcer or any lower limb ulceration present for at least 2 weeks.\nGangrene involving any portion of the lower limb or foot.\n\nExclusion from the population:\n\nPurely Venous Ulcers\nAcute Limb Ischemia/acute trash foot/ischemia due to emboli\nAcute Trauma or mangled extremity\nWounds secondary to non-atherosclerotic conditions\n\n\nMethodology of the guidelines utilized the structure of the GRADE certainty of evidence system.\nThey highlighted particular important sections in the evaluation and management of patients with CLTI: Patient Risk stratification, Limb Assessment and Severity of Limb Threat and the development of a specific evidence-based revascularisation guideline in CLTI.\nIt is important to note that compared to most guidelines, unfortunately in the management of CLTI, particularly when it comes to revascularisation, the level of evidence is generally LOW. Again, it is important to highlight that the significance of these guidelines in developing a standard approach and appropriately stratifying patients in not only management but ongoing research.\nWhat clinical evaluation is necessary for the patient with CLTI?\nIn addition to history, examination, and WIfI assessment mentioned above, for patients with diabetes and an ulcer a full assessment of neuropathy and a “probe to bone” test for any open ulcers is recommended as part of good practice.\nIn the PAD and intermittent claudication sub chapters the non-invasive methods of assessment for these patients have been discussed. In addition it is important to emphasize the role of Toe Pressures (TP) and Toe Pressure Index (TPI) in this cohort of patients.\nHealing of an ulcer or tissue loss is unlikely if a patient’s toe pressures are less than 55mmHg. And Toe Pressures have been validated in multiple studies to correlate with Amputation free survival and wound healing: Amputation Free Survival TP <30mmHg 2.13 HR (1.52-2.98). (Wickström et al. 2017; Hicks et al. 2018)\nPatients with ESRD or DM develop medial calcification and often have elevated ABPI (>1.3) - which is associated with an elevated risk of cardiovascular mortality. Outcomes in patients with ESRD are worse in relation to amputation free survival and amputation rates, regardless of revascularization strategy.(Meyer et al. 2018) Toe pressures are particularly important in this scenario. (Resnick et al. 2004; Vitti et al. 1994)\nRegarding non-invasive assessment for wound healing, a TcPO2 greater than 40mmHg has the greatest correlation with amputation stump healing.(Malone et al. 1987)"

    "section": "16.3 Management",
    "text": "16.3 Management\nWhat are the recommendations for patients with CLTI when it comes to Medical Therapy and Risk Factor Modification?\n\nTreat all patients with CLTI with an antiplatelet agent (Grade 1 Level A)\nConsider Clopidogrel as the single agent (Grade 2 Level B) – CAPRIE(Committee 1996)\nHigh-intensity statin therapy to reduce all-cause and cardiovascular mortality - Atorvastatin 80mg or Rosuvastatin 40mg. These can be titrated down to atorvastatin 40mg or rosuvastatin 20mg if unable to tolerate. (Grade 1 Level A) (Arya et al. 2018; Grundy et al. 2019)\nControl Hypertension to BP target <140mm Hg systolic and <90mm Hg diastolic in patients with CLTI (Grade 1 Level B)\nOffer Smoking Cessation interventions and ask all smokers or former smokers about status of tobacco use every visit (Grade 1 Level A)\nDiabetic foot wounds with signs of infection, erythema, swelling, pain and foul smelling drainage should be investigated with plain radiography, ESR, CRP, cultures and, managed with iv antibiotics. Signs of systemic sepsis, such as fevers, tachycardia or shock, such as hypotension, should warrant urgent debridement and drainage, regardless of vascular status.\n\nWhat imaging assessment is required?\nThe CLTI Guidelines outline an algorithm of attaining Arterial Anatomical Imaging. Starting with US and then depending on the information required, CTA, MRA, or eventually digital subtraction angiography. They emphasize the importance of obtaining good quality imaging to appropriately stage and be able to compare the level and degree of disease.\nFor wounds with concern for underlying osteomyelitis - initial workup is with plain radiography, which can identify soft tissue emphysema, evidence of osteomyelitis, or presence of a foreign body. High suspicion of early osteomyelitis with negative x-ray may warrant an MRI.(Giurato et al. 2017)\nWhat is the Global Limb Anatomic Staging System (GLASS)? (Conte et al. 2019)\nBecause the existing arterial anatomical staging of disease is vague, “lesion focused”, and not all encompassing (beyond the concept of ‘in-line pulsatile flow to the foot’), GLASS focuses on infrainguinal disease, and attempts to incorporate all aspects in its staging to improve vascular care and evidence-based revascularisation (EBR) outcomes. \nGLASS is a grading system based on anatomical and subjective assessment of calcification and incorporates two novel and important concepts:\n\nThe Target Arterial Path (TAP)\nEstimated Limb-Based Patency (LBP)\n\nAs GLASS focuses on Infrainguinal disease, with the aortoiliac (AI) segment considered the inflow disease which includes the Common Femoral Artery and the Profunda Artery. Therefore, the GLASS grades assume the inflow vessels are treated and adequately ‘dealt with’. \nInfrainguinal disease assessment for Femoropoliteal (FP) and Infrapopliteal (IP) is based on length of disease and the extent of CTOs. The FP and IP GLASS Grades are then combined into Stages 1-3. \nThe calcification scale is a dichotomous subjective assessment of the degree of calcification and if there is >50% circumference of calcification, diffuse or bulky calcification or “coral reef” plaques, then there is an increase in the within-segment grade by one numerical value.\nThere is also mention of the Inframaleolar (IM) degree of disease (PO, P1-absent arch, P2-no target artery crossing into foot) which is not included in the GLASS staging given little evidence on the outcomes this difference makes on overall patency and limb salvage.\nOnce the GRADES (0-4) of FP and IP disease are determined then staging (1-3) can be performed based on the matrix or grid that is provided. Staging then allows for estimated Peripheral endoVascular Intervention outcomes (PVI) to be predicted, Immediate Technical Failure (ITF - <10% or < 20% or > 20%)) and 1-year Limb Based Patency (LBP - >70%, 50-75% or <50%). \nWhat is the Target Arterial Path (TAP)?\n“The selected continuous route of in-line flow from groin to ankle. The TAP typically involves the least diseased IP artery but may be angiosome based.”\nWhich revascularisation management strategies exist for CLTI?\nThe mainstay of management for patients with CLTI have always been based on the fundamental principle of limb salvage. Given the high risk of limb loss in these patients there is a low threshold to revascularize these patients if they have occlusive disease that is treatable. But strategy has varied significantly.\nThe CLTI Guidelines provide an approach to dealing with this complex condition on planning three aspects to each case:\n\nPatient Risk Estimation\nLimb Staging\nAnatomic Pattern of Disease\n\nWhat is involved with the Patient Risk Estimation?\nGood Practice Statements (Recommendations section 6)\n“Refer all patients with suspected CLTI to a vascular specialist for consideration of limb salvage, unless major amputation is considered medically urgent.”\n“Offer primary amputation or palliation to patients with limited life expectancy, poor functional status (e.g. non ambulatory), or an unsalvageable limb after shared decision-making.”\nRecommendation 6.3:\n\nEstimate periprocedural risk and life expectancy in patients with CLTI who are candidates for revascularization. Grade 1 (Strong) Level of Evidence C (Low)\nAverage Surgical Risk: \\<5% operative mortality and 2-year survival >50%\nSevere Surgical Risk: \\>/= 5% operative mortality and 2-year survival </=50%\n\nUnderstanding disparities is important when interpreting risk for amputation. Observational studies have found certain populations to be at higher risk of amputation regardless of disease severity. These groups include African Americans, lowest median income, medicaid insurance, uninsured, or those from regions with less access to vascular surgeons.(Hughes et al. 2019; Ho et al. 2005; Eslami, Zayaruzny, and Fitzgerald 2007)\nWhat is involved and recommended with the Limb Staging and recommendation for Management?\n\nUse an integrated threatened limb classification system (such as WIfI) to stage all CLTI patients who are candidates for limb salvage. Grade 1 (Strong) Level of Evidence C (Low)\nPerform urgent surgical drainage and debridement (including minor amputation if needed) and commence antibiotic treatment in all patients with suspected CLTI who present with deep space foot infection or wet gangrene. (Good Practice Statement)\nOffer Revascularisation to all “average surgical risk patients” (\\<5% operative mortality and 2-year survival >50%) with advanced limb-threatening conditions (e.g. WIfI stage 4) and significant perfusion deficits (e.g. ischemia grades 2 and 3). Particularly if they have good saphenous vein. Grade 1 (Strong) Level of Evidence C (Low) (Adam et al. 2005; Norgren et al. 2007)\n\nWhat is involved in the Planning of the Anatomic pattern of disease and its effects of revascularisation strategy?\nThe overall pattern of arterial occlusive disease is a dominant factor in guiding type of revascularisation and timing of such.\nDo all patients require direct in-line flow to the foot as a primary technical outcome with revascularisation?\nPatients with rest pain do not necessarily require direct in line flow are those with rest pain “for which correction of inflow disease alone or treatment of FP disease even without continuous tibial runoff to the foot may provide relief of symptoms. This may also be the case in patients presenting with minor degrees of tissue loss.”\nWhat are some essential Key Factors to consider before deciding Open versus Endovascular according to the CLTI guidelines?\n\nThe “availability of and quality of autogenous vein conduit”7\nPatient overall risk (as mentioned above) and Limb Staging\nThe Target EndoVascular Intervention (TVI) outcomes\n\nWhat evidence do we have for deciding between Endo and Open management? What is the BASIL trial?\nThe evidence is largely of poor quality, and is largely retrospective or non-controlled, or industry sponsored. BASIL (Bypass versus Angioplasty in Severe Ischemia of the Leg) remains the only multicenter RCT (BASIL -2 and 3 underway) directly comparing an endo versus open management strategy for CLTI and Infra-inguinal occlusive disease. \nBASIL compared POBA and Bypass across multiple centers (27 centers, n=452, 1999-2004) in the UK. Primary endpoint was Amputation-Free Survival (AFS). (Bradbury et al. 2005)\nMajor Findings:\n\nAt 6-months follow up: no difference in AFS.\nIntention-To-Treat Analysis of overall follow up showed no significant difference in AFS and overall survival.\nAmong patients who survived >2 years, overall survival was better for those treated with Bypass as a first approach\nAnalysis to treat:\n\nProsthetic Bypass Patients did very poorly (even compared to POBA).\nPatients who had bypass after failed POBA had significantly worse AFS compared to those treated with a bypass as initial treatment.\n\n\nCriticism of BASIL:\n\nMajority had POBA alone (not currently best endovascular option)\n25 % of Open Bypass were Prosthetic\nThe technology and technical Skill with growing operator experience in Endovascular has improved.\n\nFor isolated tibial disease, first line endovascular treatment of choice is transluminal, or subintimal angioplasty. Atherectomy, stenting, and drug coated balloons are often used, but should currently not be considered first line, but this data is rapidly evolving. Patency is often poor but limb salvage is reasonable.(Popplewell and Bradbury 2019; Kayssi et al. 2016; Mustapha et al. 2016)\nOptimal follow up for endovascular interventions of the lower extremity has not yet been established, but should at least include a pulse exam, ABPI and duplex to establish a new baseline after intervention.(Zierler et al. 2018; Mohler et al. 2012)\nWhat are the BASIL 2, BASIL 3, and BEST-CLI Trials?\nBASIL 2: Infrapopliteal Disease: Vein Bypass First vs. Best Endovascular Treatment first.\nBASIL 3: PBA +/- BMS vs. DCB +/- BMS vs. DES\n(Both Follow up 24-60 months, Primary Endpoint AFS)\nBEST-CLI: Open Bypass versus Endovascular Intervention, Primary Endpoint: MALE-Free Survival. Major Above-the-Ankle Amputation, Major Bypass or Jump/interposition graft revision or the need for thrombectomy or thrombolysis (MALE).\nSome important take away lessons for unique scenarios in operative planning for CLTI based on anatomy and conduit.\n\nSingle segment GSV best conduit for infrageniculate bypass. (Arvela et al. 2010; Avgerinos et al. 2015; Moreira et al. 2016)\nFem-AK pop bypass with prosthetic may be preferred to contralateral GSV. (Moreira et al. 2016) If the target is below the knee, then all autogenous conduits–contralateral GSV, SSV, and spliced arm vein–are preferred over prosthetic grafts.(Brochado Neto et al. 2014; Faries et al. 2000; Taylor et al. 1987)\nBilateral external iliac occlusion may be best treated with end to side aorto-bifemoral bypass to allow for continued perfusion of the pelvis. (Jaquinandi et al. 2008; Akker et al. 1992; Brewster and Darling 1978)\nProfunda-popliteal collateral index (Segmental pressures AK-BK/AK) of less than 0.25 may suggest that there is sufficient collateral network between profunda and popliteal that SFA treatment may not be necessary. (Boren et al. 1980; Mawatari et al. 2000)\nPlanning distal bypasses should take into account the angiosome of the wound and the most distal healthy inflow vessel to result in the shortest bypass possible.(Hingorani et al. 2016; Jongsma et al. 2017)\nIntensified anti-thrombotic therapy may be needed in patients with “high risk” infrainguinal bypasses–prosthetic conduit, below the knee target, suboptimal conduit, poor arterial runoff, extensive lesions or tissue loss. Single anti-platelet may not be sufficient, and should be intensified to asa/rivaroxaban, dual antiplatelet, or anticoagulation with Vit K antagonist.(Conte et al. 2015; Hussain et al. 2018; Strobl et al. 2013; Tepe et al. 2012)\n\n\n16.3.1 Complications\nWhat are some complications of lower extremity revascularization procedures?\nFor a comprehensive list of access complications after endovascular therapy, see Section 21.1.1\nFemoral exploration carries high risk of infection or lymphatic leak. Lymphatic leaks often resolve spontaneously. Infected lymphatic leaks, particularly in the setting of prosthetic bypass require exploration. Should a lymph leak not resolve with conservative management, definitive therapy requires alcohol ablation or muscle flap coverage. The most important aspect of lymph leak is prevention with careful dissection and tissue management during femoral exploration.(Obara et al. 2014; Weaver et al. 2014)\n\n\n\n\nAdam, D. J., J. D.

    "section": "17.1 Compartment Syndrome",
    "text": "17.1 Compartment Syndrome\nWhat is the pathophysiology and presentation of compartment syndrome?\n\nIncreased intramuscular compartment pressure results from increases in capillary permeability due to ischemic reperfusion. The increase in pressure leads to neuromuscular dysfunction and interferes with circulation. Irreversible damage occurs when pressures exceed 30mmHg in each compartment.  \nIschemia reperfusion causes increased capillary permeability due to free oxygen radicals, neutrophils and endothelial factors that collect during ischemia. Severity depends on time to reperfusion, muscle mass, and flow pattern (i.e. direct or collateral). Symptoms often develop within 6 hours of reperfusion. (Keudell et al. 2015)\nThe pathophysiology underlying acute extremity compartment syndrome is related to the arteriovenous pressure gradient theory. Increased compartment pressure reduces the gradient, reducing arterial pressure and increasing venous pressure.(Frink et al. 2010; McQueen and Court-Brown 1996; Elliott and Johnstone 2003; Papalambros et al. 1989)\nClinically patients can have neurological dysfunction with sensory motor deficits, but the most common presentation is a tense extremity with severe pain on passive movement of the muscles in the compartment. If the lower leg is affected this is often on dorsiflexion/plantar flexion of the ankle. A sensitive indicator is loss of two point discrimination (proprioception).\n\nHow do you diagnose compartment syndrome?\n\nPhysical Exam: Tenderness, (especially over anterior compartment) and paresthesias (especially between first and second toes).\n\nAnterior Compartment: Sensory distribution and muscular innervation from the deep peroneal nerve (this is a VSITE favorite).\nDeep Posterior Compartment: Sensory distribution and muscular innervation from the tibial nerve(Velmahos and Toutouzas 2002).\n\nCompartment Pressures:\n\nA needle is required to access the compartment and a pressure monitoring system (this can be handheld Stryker kit, or just a hollow bore needle connected to an arterial pressure bag).\nNormal compartment pressure is <10-20mmHg; greater than 30 is highly concerning.  More accurate than an absolute number is comparing the compartment pressure to the mean arterial pressure or diastolic pressure.  If the compartment pressure is within 40mmHg of the MAP (for example, MAP is 60 and compartment pressure is 25 – this is concerning) – OR – if the difference between compartment pressure and diastolic pressure is less than 10 (for example, diastolic pressure is low at 30, and compartment pressure is 22).\n\n\nIf the clinical suspicion of compartment syndrome is high, do not be reassured by “normal” compartment pressures.  It is relatively low risk to do fasciotomies, but the risk of limb loss is high for a missed compartment syndrome.\nManagement of compartment syndrome is a fasciotomy, what are the types of fasciotomies?\n\nForearm and Upper Arm Fasciotomies: Often performed by orthopedic or hand surgeons. The forearm fasciotomy includes dorsal and volar incisions to release the dorsal and volar compartment, and mobile wad, while avoiding numerous superficial cutaneous nerves. The arm fasciotomy releases the medial, lateral, and deltoid compartments through medial lateral incisions.\nThigh: Performed through medial and lateral incisions to release the lateral, medial and posterior compartment.\nLower Leg: The most common type is a lower leg 4 compartment fasciotomy and is explained in more detail below.  \n\nHow is a lower leg 4 compartment fasciotomy for the lower extremity performed?\n\nA longitudinal incision is created between the fibular shaft and the crest of the tibia over the intermuscular septum and the anterior and lateral compartments are opened. If tissues are swollen occluding the view of the intermuscular septum, the perforating vessels can be followed down to it. Nerves including the peroneal nerve are most at risk near the fibular head.\nA second incision is created on the medial surface of the lower leg approx. 1cm posterior to the edge of the tibia to avoid the greater saphenous vein. The superficial posterior compartment is incised. The gastrocnemius-soleus complex is taken down from its attachments to the tibia in order to access the deep posterior compartment. \nThe incisions should be made generously. Sometimes the skin incision can be a little short of the fascial incision, but they should be long in order to fully release the compartments.\nAfter hemostasis loose dressings should be applied. The leg should be elevated to reduce edema that can complicate closure. Closure can be done in 48-72 hours, but may be delayed and dressed with wound vacs to attempt primary closure. If primary closure is not possible, a split thickness skin graft can be used.\n\nWho should a prophylactic fasciotomy be performed on?\n\nPatients with high occlusion and extensive ischemia.\nAcute ischemia of greater than 6 hours with few collaterals.\nPatients with combined arterial and venous injury.\nPatients who are obtunded making serial examination difficult.\n\nWhat is the prognosis for a patient with ALI? What are some patient factors that lead to a poor prognosis?\nAmputation rates after acute limb ischemia are typically described in the 10-20% range, and mortality is also in the 10-25% range whether you’re talking about surgery or catheter-directed procedures (that’s excluding the patients who present with Rutherford class III and by definition have an unsalvageable limb). Many factors determine likelihood of amputation; typically, patients with more medical comorbid conditions tend to do worse as you might expect: baseline CAD, kidney disease and smoking are predictive of worse outcomes. There is a trend toward improved limb salvage rates (decreased amputation rate) over time, and I think this speaks to wider availability of different limb salvage techniques among vascular surgeons across the globe."

    "text": "17.4 Amputations\nThe majority of questions regarding amputations stem from decision making around peripheral arterial disease. You may not see many questions asking uniquely about amputation technique or management, however this topic is VERY important for the successful management of peripheral arterial disease. Rutherford’s has two fantastic chapters on decision making(Bianchi and Jr 2018) and techniques(Eidt and Kalapatapu 2019).\nThe most commonly performed lower extremity amputations include:\n\n17.4.1 Above-knee, trans-femoral amputation (AKA)\nAbove the knee amputations are most often performed with a fish mouth incision. Suture ligation of the neurovascular bundle at the level of the mid SFA and transection of the femur.\n\n\n17.4.2 Below-knee, trans-tibial amputation (BKA)\nBelow the knee amputation often performed with a long posterior, or Burgess, flap. Each tibial neuro vascular bundle is ligated individually. The fibula is transected 2-3cm more proximally than the tibia to avoid weight bearing from the prosthetic.\nAlthough hotly debated, a Cochrane review demonstrated no difference in outcomes based on flap type. Although it does recommend performing in two stages in the setting of wet gangrene.(Tisi and Than 2014)\n\n\n17.4.3 Transmetatarsal amputation (TMA)\nTransmetatersal amputation is performed with transection of the metatarsal bones just distal to the heads. Best to transect in a graduated parabola with the 5th metatarsal most proximal. Patients may benefit from concomitant Achilles tendon lengthening to prevent equinous deformity that can result in ulceration of the medial aspect of the TMA.(Eidt and Kalapatapu 2019)\n\n\n\n\nBianchi, Christian, and Ahmed M Abou-zamzam Jr. 2018. “111.

    "section": "18.1 Chronic Venous Insufficiency",
    "text": "18.1 Chronic Venous Insufficiency\n\n18.1.1 Terminology and Presentation\nWhat is chronic venous insufficiency and how common is it?\nI thought the first question was going to be nice, easy and uncontroversial, but you’ve started with CVI. What you’ve highlighted is one of the main problems with venous disease, which is terminology. So if you type in chronic venous insufficiency into Google, you end up with, this enormous range of descriptions and how its used in lots of different ways, by lots of different people.\nOne of the problems is that this led to a lot of confusion among people within the venous space and everywhere else. A really important documents to guide people is the VEIN-TERM consensus document published in 2009.(Eklof et al. 2009) The lead author was Dr. Bo Eklof and this was a document where a group of venous experts around the world got together and said, okay, we need to be clear and define what all these different terms mean.\nAnd one of the terms that was described was chronic venous insufficiency. The official definition is it is a venous disease between C3 and C6 on the CEAP classification. We’ll talk about that a bit later, I’m sure. But between C3 and C6. In practice, it is used to describe the entire spectrum of venous disease ranging from thread veins C1 all the way up to venous ulceration. But technically it is C3 to C6. And I would urge anybody who is learning about the terminology to look at the vein term documents.(Eklöf et al. 2004; Eklof et al. 2009)\nAnd silly little things like great saphenous vein and small saphenous vein–I think UK is the only place where long saphenous is ever used and the real problem was LSV in lots of other countries will be the lesser saphenous vein, which is the small saphenous vein. So again, I’d urge anyone to look at that document.\nHow common is chronic venous insufficiency?\nChronic venous disease is very common, with the weather getting a bit nicer, people wearing shorts, you’re spotting, venous disease all over the place. The studies that have been done indicate that at least a quarter, probably up to a third of people have C2 to C6 disease. So a very common problem, with lots of people that need treatment.\nThe Edinburgh Vein Study found that half of the general population with chronic venous disease deteriorated over the 13 year study. Factors associated with disease progression included family/personal history of DVT. Of note, female gender, obesity, number of pregnancies, and smoking status were not associated with progression.(C.-C. Lee et al. 2015)\nNow we would like to discuss the classification and scoring systems, you mentioned CAEP, could you expand on that?\nSo CEAP--clinical, etiological (with an E because it’s American), anatomical, pathophysiological–classification system was introduced, I think in the mid 1990s, by the American Venous Forum. And it’s a classification system.\nSo if you have a patient that comes into your clinic with a venous problem, it’s a system to allow you to describe that patient’s current status in an objective, clear way. What it does not do is give you any information about prognostication and it isn’t useful for measuring responses to treatment.\nSo it is purely a descriptive classification system. And the most commonly used part is the clinical bit, which is C1 to C6. CEAP was just recently revised last year, a 25 year revision, which again, I would urge trainees to have a look at, Dr. Fedor Lurie was the lead author, and this was a useful revision of CEAP.(Lurie et al. 2020)\nNow in response to the limitations of CEAP, the Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS) was created. So this is a 10 item scoring system, each item scores between zero and three. So you get a maximum score of 30. Now this is designed to be responsive to treatment and complimentary to CEAP.(Vasquez et al. 2010)\nThere are lots of other things that have been described, quality of life tools or VDS, but I would say that those two (CEAP and VCSS) are the most relevant and important ones to know about. Many of the QOL tools are too cumbersome to use in day to day practice. We are in dire need of a easy to use clinical tool that is validated for assessment of patient reported outcomes. And again, the number of papers I’ve reviewed where people have reported CEAP scores as one of the outcome measures in response to treatments. That is not what it’s designed for, for example, you can never get lower than C5. You can never get better than a healed ulcer. So again, that’s the important distinction.\n\n\n18.1.2 Evaluation\nWhen we do see patients in clinic with chronic venous insufficiency, which type of imaging modalities should we use to investigate the function and the anatomy of the lower limbs?\nIf a patient comes to clinic, we can’t underestimate the importance of the clinical assessment. And when you assess these patients, you are really looking for the impact of their venous disease on their quality of life and the impact of the venous disease has on their normal function.\nBut also you’re looking for complications of venous disease. This is a clinical assessment. But then when ordering investigations, you really want to identify underlying treatable causes of their venous disease. And that’s the goal of any investigation.\nVenous duplex imaging is obviously the first line, gold standard that pretty much anybody will go to around the world. And what that does is essentially gives you information about the venous flow, antegrade or retrograde or refluxing flow in superficial and deep veins.\nIt’ll give you information about the anatomy of the veins , which will help you to plan treatment, but it also gives you lots of other information as well. It gives you information in the common femoral vein, for example, if there’s good phasicity of flow or if there’s any scarring. It helps you to evaluate whether there might be some outflow obstruction, so duplex imaging is the absolute first line, gold standard. For more on venous duplex scanning, see Section 20.7.\nNow, once you’ve done the duplex imaging, if there’s clinical suspicion, then of course we can move on to other investigations. So proximal CTV, MRV, venography, IVUS. But clinical assessments and duplex assessment are the bedrock of every assessment of every venous patient. So that’s the foundation.\n\n\n18.1.3 Management\nMoving on to the treatment of superficial disease. When we talk about treatment of superficial venous incompetence, I don’t think we can really get away from talking about the two major studies, the ESCHAR(Manjit S. Gohel et al. 2007) and the EVRA(Manjit S. Gohel et al. 2018) studies, which I know you’ve been involved with. Can you review what these studies showed and their importance in the care of our patients.\nBefore I go into the trials, I’m just going to go back a step and just talk about the general mindset that’s important for these patients. So what we’re treating with these patients is not superficial venous reflux. What we’re treating is chronic venous hypertension. So we’re treating a pathophysiological entity of which the superficial reflux is one correctable factor. And the reason that’s important is that there may be other correctable factors, such as venous outflow obstruction, which may be addressed. Decision making also takes into account patient presentation. For example a patient with asymptomatic varicose veins, even with proximal obstruction and superficial reflux, should still only be treated with compression.(Boezem et al. 2011; Wittens et al. 2015)\nBut there are also going to be lots of uncorrectable factors, such as poor mobility, heart failure, dependency, ankle stiffness. If your ankle is stiff, you can’t use your calf muscle to pump effectively. You don’t have that mechanism for reducing the venous pressure in your legs. So the success of these treatments, particularly for the ulcer population, has to be taken in the context of treating venous hypertension as well.\nHaving said that, the aim of these trials was really very simple. Most patients with venous ulceration have superficial reflux. So what is the role of treating the superficial reflux? That’s the simple question that was asked by these trials.\nThe ESCHAR trial recruited between 1999 and 2002, and included 500 patients with healed and open leg ulcers. They were either randomized to compression or compression and traditional, superficial venous surgery (stripping or ligation). And that trial was very clear. It showed that with venous stripping there wasn’t a benefit for healing, but there was a significant and sizable reduction in the risk of ulcer recurrence.(Manjit S. Gohel et al. 2007)\nSo one of the criticisms of ESCHAR was lots of people didn’t have the same surgery. Lots of people had just ligation alone, et cetera. We don’t really do stripping anymore, it’s all endovenous. So EVRA really aimed to bring the ESCHAR trial up to modern practice. We randomized 450 patients with open leg ulcers to early endovenous treatments, delivered within two weeks versus a more delayed approach. What EVRA showed, again is common sense, if you deal with the underlying problem (usually superficial reflux), the venous ulceration healed significantly quicker.(Manjit S. Gohel et al. 2018)\nSo putting them together, there is a clear, unequivocal argument for treating the superficial reflux in these patients as quickly as possible.\n\n18.1.3.1 Endovenous\nCan you broadly outline the different treatment options that can be offered to patients with superficial venous reflex?\nI have counted about 42 different ways of destroying a saphenous vein. There are lots of different treatment options. Do something that you’re trained in and proficient with and something that’s appropriate. Thermal ablation is in the NICE guidance and in lots of other international guideline documents has been combined, whether it’s radiofrequency or laser. Although foam sclerotherapy therapy, when studied in randomized trials, has lower technical success rates and lower vein closure rates, the clinical success rates in terms of healing are just as good. This reduced effectiveness in closing the vein, doesn’t really seem to translate into a significant drop in clinical effectiveness after foam sclerotherapy.\nSo I think the most important thing is not necessarily what you use, it’s doing it quickly and delivering it to the people that need it. However, there are a few relative contraindications to GSV ablation.(Atasoy 2015; Gloviczki et al. 2011; Lowell S. Kabnick and Sadek 2019) These include:\n\nGSV >12mm width raises concern for incomplete obliteration\nSuperficial GSV unlikely to be pushed down with tumescence - could cause staining or thermal injury to the skin\nGSV tortuosity may limit the ability to pass a catheter and sufficiently ablate the vein\nAcute superficial vein thrombosis.\n\nWhen we are consenting patients for endovenous intervention, what risks should we discuss with the patient and that they need to be aware of?\nYou can spend an hour doing this, if you’re being very diligent. But what I say to patients are that there are generic risks of venous thromboembolism, as is the risk of any intervention. And I think that’s worthy of specific discussion after endovenous procedures, but I quote a risk of around one in 200 for most endovenous interventions. Extension of proximal thrombus into the deep system is termed endothermal heat-induced thrombosis (EHIT) and is evaluated and treated aggressively in the United States.(Sadek et al. 2013; Lowell S. Kabnick et al. 2021) EHIT is defined as:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEHIT Grade\nDescription\nTreatment\n\n\n\n\n1\nExtension to SFJ\nNone\n\n\n2\nExtension into deep system <50% of lumen diameter\nClose observation vs anticoagulation\n\n\n3\nExtension into the deep system >50% of lumen diameter\nAnticoagulation\n\n\n4\nOcclusion of the femoral or popliteal vein\nAnticoagulation\n\n\n\nThere’s always a risk of bruising. And if you do phlebectomies, what I often tell people is that bruising sometimes looks worse than it feels. And with the thermal interventions in particular, I think the risk of nerve related complications, so some numbness or some nerve pain, are worthy of mentioned, and of course the risk of recurrence. Recurrence of varicose veins in the lateral thigh may be related to untreated anterior accessory greater saphenous vein disease.(Laredo, Lee, and Neville 2010)\nFoam sclerotherapy has a different mechanism of action. It’s a detergent that’s injected into the vein that destroys the endothelium. And there are some people that have associated foam sclerotherapy with some neurological events. So a very large registry that was organized by the manufacturers of STS recently looked at 10,000 patients in the UK and found very few events-around one in 4-5,000.\nThere are a number of complications related to sclerotherapy that should be understood. Hyperpigmentation is probably the most common complication (11-80%), but only a small percentage persist up to a year (1-2%). Incision and drainage of the thrombus 2-4 weeks after treatment may reduce hyperpigmentation. New appearance of fine red telangiectasias (AKA telangiectatic matting) is related to underlying vessel injury in 5-57% of patients and can persist up to 1 year (1%). Cutaneous necrosis is rare (<1%) and results from extravasation of sclerosing agent, injection into dermal arteriole, reactive vasospasm or excessive cutaneous pressure. DVT and cutaneous nerve injury are also rare.(Bergan, Pascarella, and Mekenas 2006; Munavalli and Weiss 2007)\nSome people say that if there is a history of migraine, then the risk of these neurological events might be a little bit higher. So, a little bit of caution, although in practice, I’ve treated many people with migraines. But if you believe the literature, one in four or five, people have got a little ASD and obviously we treated lots of those people, so the risks are very low but it’s just important to have that discussion beforehand.\nAre there any techniques that we can use to mitigate some of these risks?\nSo I think VTE is something that is really worth specifically discussing. It’s a very rare event after superficial venous interventions, but it’s potentially catastrophic, with sometimes national press coverage for bad outcomes. What we’ve got to realize is that the rate of VTE events is very low, there are almost certainly some people that have a higher risk. And so what we’ve got to get slightly smarter about is identifying the people that have a higher risk of VTE and maybe giving them prolonged course of thromboprophylaxis, as well as appropriate counseling and mitigation as well.\nSo it’s about getting smarter about risk assessment. The current risk assessment tools are not really fit for purpose when it comes to superficial venous intervention. So the department of health or the Caprini tools don’t really take into account some of the really important factors that I think do impact on VTE risk after superficial venous interventions.\nThere’s nothing validated, there’s nothing widely available, but we have a local, specific risk assessment for patients having superficial venous interventions. There are major risk factors we look out for, such as previous ipsilateral VTE, active malignancy, but also significant chronic inflammatory conditions (i.e. inflammatory bowel disease), these patients have a much higher risk of VTE than we previously recognized. There are also minor factors, superficial vein thrombosis, obesity, comorbidities. All of these things are put together and we come out with a score. For patients above a certain threshold, they get offered extended rivaroxaban or low molecular weight heparin.\nIn addition, it is important to implement mitigation. So traditionally things like a contraceptive pill, HRT and Tamoxifen, we wouldn’t usually stop them for a local anesthetic procedure, but being on an estrogen containing pill doubles or triples your risk of VTE. It’s an easily reversible thing in the short term that can be done. So for my patients, I would normally recommend that we stop the pill or HRT a full month before and after the procedure.\nFor preventing EHIT specifically, the radiofrequency ablation (RFA) catheter should be placed 2cm from the SFJ. EHIT is a primarily technical complication.(Joh et al. 2014)\nYou mentioned it an extended course of anticoagulation for those patients with risk factors. Is there a specific timescale locally that you use for this?\nThe venous forum produced some guidance the year before last in exactly this area. We often only do about a week or 10 days for a lot of these patients. However, if there’s an ongoing, persistent risk factor, then actually the VTE risk persists for four to six weeks, and thus there may be an argument for up to six weeks of therapy in particularly high risk patients.\nHowever, if they are really that high risk, you’ve really got to question whether a superficial venous intervention is needed, balancing the risks and the benefits. But since for some patients the high risk period persists for at least another six weeks afterwards, be careful not to stop prophylaxis too soon.\nMoving on to a more specific question about treatment, what is the role for treating and competent perforator veins in these patients?\nIn general, the more advanced the venous disease, the more likely it is that the disease is recurrent, the more likely there is to be deep venous disease or posts thrombotic disease, and the more likely you are to finding incompetent perforators. If you imagine these patients with venous ulcer, it is very common to find perforators, and if you take a sort of super aggressive role saying you’ve got to obliterate every single bit of reflux you can find, then you’d be doing a couple of perforators in every single patient, and that is the approach of a number of centers around the world.\nThe pragmatic reality is, number one, if you ablate the superficial reflux, we know that a lot of these perforators actually become competent because we’ve got rid of the outflow or you’ve changed the dynamics in some other way, and they’ve become competent. Number two, even if they’ve stayed incompetent, the clinical benefit is still there and is usually still pretty durable. The clinical criteria most often used to as an indication for treatment is >350ms of deep to superficial reflux, diameter greater than 3.5mm (associated with reflux in 90% of patients)(Sandri et al. 1999) and near a healed or active ulcer.(O’Donnell et al. 2014; Min, Khilnani, and Golia 2003; Rueda et al. 2013)\nNow, of course, there may be some people that develop recurrent problems and then there can be a more targeted approach to the perforator. The ESCHAR and EVRA studies did not target perforators at all and the outcomes in the EVRA study was the best healing rate of any published prospective leg ulcer study. So, putting all that together, it’s difficult to make a case for aggressive treatment of perforators first up. Having said that for some people with recurrent disease, it’s not uncommon to have a big mid thigh Huntarian perforator or Cocker’s perforator lower down on the medial calf. So, I do treat perforators, but almost always it’s in recurrent disease with recurrence or deteriorating symptoms.\n\n\n18.1.3.2 Open Surgery\nSo we’ve discussed quite a bit about endovenous intervention. Is there a role for open surgery in some patients?\nOpen surgery remains the most commonly used superficial venous intervention around the world, and there are still lots of centers in the UK that primarily offer open surgery. Being balanced, it’s a very effective treatment if you do it well and if you use modern approaches, such as tumescent anesthesia and ultrasound guidance, then actually some of the traditional issues with open surgery, which are often technical and complication related, don’t really apply.\nHaving said that, all the randomized trials have shown the same thing while the effectiveness may be as good in open surgery done well, the recovery is much better after endovenous ablation. So it’s difficult to make the case for open surgery when you’ve got something that is so well established and the complications just so low, and it’s cheaper when you look at their theater capacity, et cetera.\nSo, I think there has to be a move towards endovenous, but there are lots of things stopping this. In Germany, for example, the reimbursement is greatest for open surgery. So surprise, surprise, there are still lots and lots of open varicose vein operations. For trainees, it is important to recognize that if you want to change practice, the single biggest driver for change is reimbursement. You can change whatever you like. So, I’ve treated maybe three patients with open surgery in the last five years. One was a GP, who I had treated the other leg with open surgery a few years earlier, and she said, “I want the same operation, please.” So I did struggle to argue with that. The other two were big three, four, five centimeters saphenovarices in the groin. So specific indications, but not really for most patients.\nFor deep venous reflux, surgical management follows a relatively complex algorithm.(O’Donnell et al. 2014) Valve prolapse due to vein wall dilation may be treated with external banding. Isolated valve prolapse may be treated with external valvuloplasty, and in severe cases an internal valvuloplasty. When no adequate valve exists, then valve transplant from a distant source, such as the axilla, may be necessary.(Kabbani et al. 2011) These are not commonly performed procedures and should be referred to centers with significant experience.\n\n\n18.1.3.3 Medical Therapy\nSo we’ve talked about endovenous and surgical treatment, but are there any pharmacological therapies that can be used in patients with chronic venous insufficiency?\nSo we’re pretty skeptical in the UK, when it comes to venoactive or pharmacological treatments. If you go to Europe, they love them. They’re over the counter in a lot of pharmacies. The drug with probably the most evidence is something called Daflon, micronized purified flavonoid fraction.\nSo flavonoids are naturally occurring, venoactive compounds. There are a whole variety of effects, only some of which we understand. But a lot of studies have shown improvements in edema and heaviness. Daflon is marketed by a French company and it’s got good evidence, but they do not see places like the UK as a big enough market because of our inherent skepticism over these sort of things, to make it worth their while to go through the marketing and the regulatory processes. So it’s not available. But patients that have gone to France and picked it up over the counter and have said it works well. So there may be a roll for some venoactive medications such as pentoxyphyllin —there’s some good evidence that it accelerates healing of leg ulcers.\nBut I don’t think we’re very receptive in the UK in general, not in the vascular surgery community to prescribe pharmacological or herbal type remedies.\nWound management in patients with venous insufficiency however has many medical adjuncts. Topic agents include excimer (cadexomer) iodine, silver sulfadiazine, silver-containing dressings, growth factors or cell-based therapy.\nWhat are the healthcare costs associated with the lower extremity venous disease?\nThe educated guesstimates in the UK, NHS, is around 2 billion pounds a year. The UK NHS budget is about a 120 billion. So, up to about 2% of the budget, and that’s just C6 disease. We’re not even going into all of the other diseases, the associated cellulitis, but also not only the healthcare costs, but the societal costs, the time off work, the other things. And then of course the superficial vein thrombosis, VTE and other associated diseases, it’s a massive underestimate.\n\n\n\n18.1.4 Other Complications of Superficial Venous Disease\n\n18.1.4.1 Superficial Vein Thrombosis\nYou mentioned superficial vein thrombosis, also known as superficial thrombophlebitis. What is it and how do you manage it?\nI’m very pleased you used both terms because I’m going to take the opportunity to encourage robustly the use of superficial vein thrombosis rather than thrombophlebitis. The problem with thrombophlebitis is it is too closely associated with an infectious etiology, which can lead to useless courses of antibiotics. Of course, there’s no infection, it’s a thrombus in a superficial vein. Traditionally, it’s just been seen as just a bit of a nuisance and let’s not worry about it, treat with analgesia and anti-inflammatories, and you’ll be fine.\nIt can be a really sinister pathology and associated with VTE. If you think of how many thousands, millions of people that have varicose veins. They don’t all get clots in their varicose veins. They’ve all got stasis to a certain extent but they don’t get clots. So it’s more than just the flow dynamics going on here. These people likely have an thrombogenic innate tendency that leads to this. That’s shown out in the studies, some really good work in some French studies, such as the POST study. They identified patients who were scanned with superficial vein thrombosis, and a quarter of them on their first duplex scan had a DVT. A lot of these DVTs were remote to the superficial vein thrombosis.(Decousus et al. 2010) So they’re not all extending into the deep vein—they were remote—confirming this idea that actually a thrombogenic problem is going on here. A patient with superficial vein thrombus and a previous history of DVT could suggest a subsequent risk of VTE up to 20%.\nSo in the latest ESVS guidelines, there is quite a lot of content about SVT treatment with algorithms. I would urge people to have a look at that, and it’s important to risk stratify people. Limited disease can be followed with ultrasound at 1-2 weeks, but the closer you are to the junction, the higher VTE risk, and actually for anyone other than just a bit of clot in a varicosity, anticoagulation is the treatment of choice to reduce progression to VTE.(Kakkos et al. 2021; Di Nisio, Wichers, and Middeldorp 2018; Scovell, Ergul, and Conrad 2018)\n\n\n\nNSAIDs and Warm Compresses\nAnticoagulation\n\n\n\n\nLow risk Patients\nHigh risk patients\n\n\nSegment less than 5cm\nSegment greater than 5cm\n\n\nRemote from SFJ\nLess than 5cm from SFJ\n\n\n\nCALISTO is the largest RCT and used treatment with 2.5mg SC Fondaparinux.(Group et al. 2010; Blondon et al. 2012) Rivaroxaban did subsequently demonstrate non-inferiority.(Werth et al. 2016) So look at the guidelines, it’s very clear what we should be doing with these people, evidence-based, Once the anticoagulation is done, they need to be re-scanned and that residual incompetent, scarred thrombogenic, saphenous vein needs to be ablated or excised, otherwise they’ll recur. So a real change in mindset and level of aggression.(Kakkos et al. 2021; Di Nisio, Wichers, and Middeldorp 2018; Scovell, Ergul, and Conrad 2018)\nPregnant patients are often high risk for lower extremity venous complications and pose difficult clinical challenges. Extensive superficial vein thrombus in pregnant patients should be treated with LMWH and paused at delivery.(Kupelian and Huda 2007; Litzendorf and Satiani 2011) If symptoms persist 3-6mo after delivery, the further workup for pelvic congestive syndrome may be required with a transvaginal ultrasound or cross sectional imaging.(Labropoulos et al. 2017)\n\n\n18.1.4.2 Bleeding\nWhat’s your approach to managing patients with bleeding varicose veins?\nReally important question. It is a vascular emergency. There are several depressing reports of patients having died from bleeding from a varicosity. These are often elderly patients who are frail, with limited mobility , and therefore can’t bend down to press on the bleeding varicosity down by the ankle ulcer. There’s some very grim photos in various case reports and it’s really sad. There’s two or three photos that I’ve seen where an elderly patient has not wanted to wake their partner and so has gone and laid down in the bath with this bleeding vein that they couldn’t control and basically exsanguinated.\nSo, it’s a vascular emergency and these patients should be seen and assessed and their superficial venous disease should be dealt with as soon as possible. We have an emergency clinic running and anyone with bleeding veins have the same urgency as the CLI patients and they were treated there and then.\nIn terms of the treatment, there’s two aspects: you want to decompress the venous hypertension by ablating the saphenous reflux, but for the specific bleeding area, I think there’s a real case for some local foam sclerotherapy. You want to block off that vulnerable bleeding vein to ensure that this doesn’t happen again. But again, if anyone receives a referral, these are people to see straight away."

    "text": "18.2 Acute Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT)\nSo let’s move on to discuss deep venous thrombosis. You’re recently involved in the European society of vascular surgery, venous thrombosis guidelines. In the most part, calf DVTs are managed by medical teams or dedicated DVT services within the hospital. So in this section, we’ll be focusing mostly on proximal DVT.\n\n18.2.1 Demographics\n\n18.2.1.1 Physiology\nIn medical school, we’ve learned a lot about Virchow’s triad and the etiology of venous thrombosis. Does that simple concept still hold true today?\nI think it does. There’s a few caveats and a few nuances, but I think the principle that the flow, the vessel wall, and the blood constituents are the main factors that affect whether or not you get thrombosis in a vein is still pretty solid. However, there is also a real change in mindset about the whole idea of provoked and unprovoked DVT. Again, I would urge people to look at some of the new areas that we’ve covered in these guidelines.\n\n\n18.2.1.2 Prevalence\nIncidence of DVT increases with age by a factor of 1.9 per 10 years. Of patients who develop DVT, 1% will have phlegmasia and 10% may develop a pulmonary embolism.\nFor post-thrombotic syndrome, 17% will develop at 1 year and 29% by 8 years after the initial DVT. For recurrence, 30% will develop over 10 years but the highest risk for recurrence is in the first year.(Beckman et al. 2010; Bulger, Jacobs, and Patel 2004; Meissner et al. 2007)\n\n\n18.2.1.3 Etiology\nYou mentioned there about potential risk factors for DVT, and that can be classified into these provoked, which can be transient or persistent, and then unprovoked risk factors. Can you talk about some of the specific factors and causes?\nIn general, what’s been happening for several years is a recognition that there are some DVTs that happened with a clear provoking factor—a common major, transient, provoking factor is major surgery, for example. So a lot of DVT are caused with that clear provoking factor, but there’s an enormous population of people that don’t have a clear provoking factor at all, or have a minor factor that may or may not have contributed.\nSo traditionally there’s been a dichotomy between provoked and unprovoked. If it’s provoked, they get a limited period of anticoagulation is unprovoked it’s long-term anticoagulation. And certainly the last big thrombosis guidelines was the ACCP guidelines, the American CHEST guidelines, and that’s what they suggested, but it’s much more nuanced than that.\nWhat we’ve got to remember is that there are some provoked DVTs where there’s much higher risk, and those are there’s some unprovoked DVTs, which actually there may be other factors that you need to take into account. So I think for those people that are interested in this area, it’s really important to get to the nitty-gritty. So, long-winded way of answering your question. But here are some risk factors:\n\nMajor provokes\n\nSurgery\nMajor trauma\n\nMinor provoked\n\nShorter periods of immobility - a few days sick in bed with the flu\nContraceptive pill - depending on whether it was just started or the patient has been taking for two to three years\n\n\nIn the guideline document is a big, long list of other things where for people to think about it and consider.\nIn this review we are discussing mostly lower extremity DVTs, however catheter-associated DVTs are sometimes encountered on examinations. In general the DVT is considered to be a result of the line. However, management is treatment of the DVT with or without line removal. If the line is functioning well and the patient requires the line for other therapy, then simply treating the DVT with anticoagulation should be sufficient.(Kearon et al. 2016; Kovacs et al. 2007) Treatment is similar in patients with cancer.(Debourdeau et al. 2009)\nPrevention is a key component to mitigating the impacts of DVT. One of the more common risk stratification tools in the United States is the Caprini risk assessment model.(Bahl et al. 2010) Patients identified to be high risk according to the Caprini risk index require mechanical prophylaxis, pharmacological prophylaxis and early ambulation.(Gould et al. 2012; Laryea and Champagne 2013)\nIn those patients where, after you’ve taken a thorough history, there’s no obvious provoking factors. Is there a role for screening for occult malignancies and thrombophilias?\nFor thrombophilia testing, the history of it is really interesting. When they were first identified and our ability to screen them first became available, there’s a lot of excitement because people thought they were going to be able to identify a clear cause for all of these unprovoked DVTs. The reality is that at least 50% of them, there’s no identifiable thrombophilia. So what it almost certainly means is there’s lots of thrombophilias that we haven’t yet identified, we can’t test for. So it hasn’t really been the panacea in that regard. The other pragmatic reality for the thrombophilias is that if we’re going to be putting people on long-term anticoagulation anyway, the additional value of testing for these things is really very minimal.\nAnd the ones that are really important—the thrombosis history is so stark that they normally smack you in the face. So I think it’s generally gone out of fashion. And again, there’s only very specific circumstances where we would suggest testing them:\n\nIf you’re going to be trying to stop anticoagulation, for some reason, the patients don’t want to be on it, or if there’s bleeding risks\nThere’s a clear family history. Then it might be worth excluding some of the more sinister thrombophilias.\n\nOtherwise, certainly not a role for routine testing and similarly for malignancy—for unprovoked DVT, the prevalence of an underlying malignancy is somewhere between 6-10%. The studies that have looked at an aggressive, thorough assessment process rather than a more selective process, have picked up a few more cancers, but the additional cost in terms of anxiety, additional investigations, et cetera, and no demonstrable improvement in outcome has meant that the guidelines have not recommended routine cancer screening beyond the appropriate, symptom driven age and sex specific screening—PSA, breast assessments, colonoscopy, etc.\nOne unique situation is recurrent or migratory superficial vein thrombosis, particularly in older patients, can be associated with an underlying malignancy.(Litzendorf and Satiani 2011)\nFor patients with established diagnosis of thrombophilia (Factor V Leiden homozygous mutation, antithrombin deficiency, prothrombin G20201A homozygous) who become pregnant, recommendations state they should be on LMWH prophylaxis during pregnancy and 6w postpartum regardless of personal history of DVT.(Heit et al. 2005)\n\n\n\n18.2.2 Evaluation\nWhat is the algorithm for investigation?\nThe most important part is the first component of the algorithm, which is an assessment of the pre-test probability of DVT. So anyone who comes with a DVT, you can go through a validated tool. The most common is the Wells probability score, which is a series of questions and give you an indication as to whether a DVT is likely or unlikely. (Tritschler et al. 2018)\nIf a DVT is likely, then the algorithm is to do a scan, very straightforward. If a DVT is unlikely, then the algorithm is to do a D-dimer. Because if that is negative, DVT is effectively excluded. The guidelines are very clear on the assessment process, but a lot of this won’t reach our radars as vascular specialists at all until the DVT has been diagnosed, so we don’t appreciate the importance of the early stages. So again, a quick plug for the guidelines, there’s a very nice algorithm, beautiful colors—I definitely recommend having a look.\nOn ultrasound, acute DVT is characterized by an enlarged vein with a non-compressible lumen and hypoechoic thrombus. Chronic post-thrombotic scarring is often contracted with echogenic appearance.(Yusof et al. 2019) For more details, see Section 20.7.\n\n\n18.2.3 Management\n\n18.2.3.1 Medical\nSo the exact choice and duration of anticoagulation in the management of a DVT is probably beyond the scope of this podcast, but on the whole are DOACs preferred over vitamin K antagonists, such as Warfarin and why?\nIn a word, yes, lots and lots of studies, funded by big companies that make DOACs, have been done and they’ve all shown fairly consistent things. They’ve shown that the DOACs are as effective as the vitamin K antagonists at preventing DVT. They have almost always a significantly lower bleeding risk, but they’ve got this enormous added convenience of not needing regular blood tests, not having this dietary limitations, and the erratic control, et cetera. So the general direction of travel is inexorably towards more and more use of DOACs.\nA couple of other areas where DOACs have really shined: The tendency is to recommend longer courses of anticoagulation and often indefinite anticoagulation. A number of studies, both rivaroxaban and Apixaban have looked at the effect of a lower dose of DOAC in these patients. So if you need to extend anticoagulation, can you use a lower dose, a prophylactic dose, so 10mg of rivaroxaban or 2.5mg BID of Apixaban. The results have been impressive because the prevention of recurrent VTE is very good, the same as the therapeutic dose, but the bleeding risk is much lower. So you’ve got this additional benefit of being able to give an even load those with even lower bleeding risk.\nAnd the real icing on the cake for the DOAC has been a few recent studies that have been looking at cancer patients. Traditionally cancer patients where low-molecular weight heparin only, not for DOACs.(Kearon et al. 2016) But the Hokusai study(Raskob et al. 2018) and the Caravaggio study(Agnelli et al. 2020) more recently have both looked at Edoxaban and Apixaban in the context of cancer and have shown that actually they’re very effective. In addition, a recent meta-analysis found that recurrence rates were lower with DOACs, but bleeding rates were no different.(Dong et al. 2019; Rossel et al. 2019)\nIn almost all of the areas, DOACs are demonstrating their superiority. The one very notable exception is antiphospholipid syndrome, particularly triple positive antiphospholipid syndrome. This is a pretty nasty acquired thrombophilia where Warfarin is still the gold standard.(Pengo et al. 2018)\nTo step back a little, trainees should make sure they understand some basics behind the coagulation pathway and anticoagulants. Warfarin is one of the most studied and longest used anticoagulants and is a Vitamin K antagonist. Vit K is essential for activation of factors IX, X, VII, prothrombin (II), C and S, which are integral to the extrinsic pathway of coagulation.(Fair, Marlar, and Levin 1986; Wu, Morris, and Stafford 1991) The extrinsic pathway is activated by vessel wall damage and exposure of tissue thromboplastin or tissue factor (TF), which binds Factor VIIa activating Factor X and Xa.(Morrissey 2001)\nWarfarin induced skin necrosis is important to understand, although very rare (0.01-0.1%). This occurs shortly after initiating warfarin and presents with purple, cool, painful toes and punctate areas of necrosis and petechiae. Treatment includes immediate cessation of warfarin and transition to LMWH, normalization of INR with Vit K and FFP.(Pourdeyhimi and Bullard 2014; Tran et al. 2013)\nReversal agents are also another tested topic in the medical management of vascular disease. Other anticoagulants and their reversal agents include:\n\nDabigitran - Idarucizumab.(Glund et al. 2019)\nEdoxaban, apixiban and rivaroxaban - andexanet alfa.(Connolly et al. 2019)\nNonspecific with some effect on other DOACs - PPC, Factor 7, and activated PPC.(Cuker et al. 2019; Kearon et al. 2016)\n\nFinally it is also good to be aware of a few additional coagulation factors and their function:\n\nIntegrin glycoprotein GPIa/IIa - platelet aggregation\nProtease-activated receptors (PARs) - platelet aggregation\nThrombomodulin - activation of protein C\nPlasminogen activator inhibitor-1 - suppression of plasmin formation/fibrinolysis.\n\nPatients with a proximal DVT, in the iliofemoral or the femoropopliteal segment, is there a role for elastic compression in the acute phase?\nTraditionally people have been a bit nervous about putting compression on patients with acute DVT, concerns about causing propagation and causing PEs. A very important study was the ideal DVT study(Ten Cate-Hoek et al. 2018), run by Dutch colleagues, and a number of other additional studies more recently that have built on the original IDEAL DVT study.(Schreurs et al. 2022)\nThe short answer to your question is that early compression is really important. It’s a really positive thing to do within 24 hours and it’s proper compression. It’s not just the Ted stocking and see what happens. It’s 30 to 40 mmHg, so that in practice is a class two stocking with a bandage on top. The benefits are that this reduces the early pain and swelling of the DVT, but also interestingly, it reduces the risk of post-thrombotic syndrome and post-thrombotic venous obstruction. So if you put compression on early, it reduces the risk of them developing post-thrombotic syndrome. So a lot of focus has been on clearing the vein and early thrombus removal and thrombolysis and thrombectomy and all this sort of aggressive stuff. But just by doing the compression, we can have at least part of the same effect and we’ve just not been doing it. Very rarely do these patients get proper compression.\nSo there is a big section in the ESVS guidelines about the role of compression and algorithm as to when, how to use it, and how long do you use it for. What we want to see now is the DVT pathways around the country, around the world, updated and amended with this latest guidance.(Kakkos et al. 2021)\n\n18.2.3.1.1 Complications - Pulmonary Embolism\nMore and more vascular surgeons are becoming involved with Pulmonary Embolism Response Teams (PERT) and so surgeons should be familiar with the acute management of DVTs that progress to pulmonary embolism. The majority of pulmonary embolisms simply require anticoagulation.\nHowever, if a patient becomes hemodynamically unstable, such as develops hypotension, then the patient should undergo systemic thrombolysis.(Kearon et al. 2016) Contraindications to systemic thrombolysis include:\n\nAge >75\nIntracranial neoplasm\nIntracranial/spinal surgery or trauma with the last 2 months\nHistory of hemorrhagic stroke\nActive bleeding or known bleeding disorder\nNon-hemorrhagic stroke within the past 3 months.\n\nPatients who do not immediately respond to systemic thrombolysis, are a high risk of bleeding, or in shock that may cause death before thrombolytics take effect, then catheter based thrombus removal may be considered. This complex decision making is best made through the previously mentioned PERT.(Xenos et al. 2019) Endovascular techniques include:\n\nThrombus fragmentation\nSuction thrombectomy\nRotational embolectomy\nUltrasound assisted thrombolysis\n\nThere are very high risk procedures and complications include pulmonary artery perforation, pericardial tamponade, cardiogenic shock, hemaglobinuria or other hemorrhagic complications.\n\n\n18.2.3.1.2 Complications - Post Thrombotic Syndrome\nOne of the concerning complications of a DVT, particularly a proximal DVT is post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). Can you recap the symptoms of PTS and how it’s diagnosed?\nPTS is a fairly amorphous entity that includes a series of patient symptoms and clinical signs that develop after deep vein thrombosis. That’s deliberately very vague, because the condition is so variable. In terms of diagnosing PTS, the official diagnostic tool is a score of five or more on the Villalta scale. The Villalta score is another one of these tools that have been developed for both making a diagnosis, but also assessing progression of PTS.(Kahn et al. 2014; Villalta et al. 1994)\nBut in terms of sort of symptoms—people get swelling, heaviness, pain. There is a very unique symptom, which is venous claudication, which is almost pathonogmonic of post-thrombotic syndrome with venous outflow obstruction. It’s this pain which has a bursting tense quality in the calf on exertion, which does settle on stopping, but it takes a lot longer than arterial claudication. So sometimes people will take half an hour to get better and the leg has to be elevated. So that’s venous claudication and that’s often the most disabling symptom. But of course, people can develop the same clinical complications than you can with any venous disease—skin changes, lipodermatosclerosis, venous leg ulceration, et cetera. Those are the summery of symptoms for PTS, seen in up to 50% but probably closer to 25% of proximal DVT.\n\n\n18.2.3.1.3 Complications - IVC Filters\nA quick question about IVC filters. As vascular surgeons, we sometimes get asked about the appropriateness of inserting an IVC filter. When would you consider one and how long can one stay in situ for?\nSo short answer is I virtually never consider one, and if already in situ, remove as soon as possible. Let’s expand on this a little bit. So the history of IVC filters is a painful story, particularly in the US, super aggressive use of IVC filters, very few of them retrieved, lots of IVC occlusions, and major lawsuits against big companies. The most important factor in successful IVC filter retrieval is dwell time less than 7 months. Type of filter, tilting or protruding struts are not associated with failure. Adverse events have found to be as high as 2%.(Desai et al. 2017) That’s led to a worldwide, reluctance to use IVC filter, so now we may not be using them in some cases when we should be using them. The traditional indications and reasons for using IVC filters included weird and wonderful things like floating thrombus and other factors.\nThe reality is the only real indication that we could come up with was when there’s a proximal DVT, and there’s a clear contraindication to anticoagulation. So if there’s no anticoagulation, then the risk of propagation and PE is reasonably high, so there is a strong case for a temporary IVC filter. If a patient is anticoagulated, very rarely can the case be made for an IVC filter. I don’t want to go into nuanced details—such as where somebody already had a PE there’s right heart strain, there may be some anatomical features that you’re worried about, their anticoagulant control is borderline—there might be specific cases, but this is really very rare. Most people anticoagulated do not need an IVC filter.\nA rather challenging and unique patient would be a pregnant patient with a DVT and placenta previa. Anticoagulation is contraindicated in placenta previa and in addition, an infrarenal IVC filter is also contraindicated, so she would require a suprarenal IVC filter.(Bates et al. 2018; DeYoung and Minocha 2016; Harris, Velineni, and Davies 2016)\nIn the setting of a thrombosed filter, a patient may require urgent intervention if they develop phlegmasia. Suprarenal filter placement may be useful during the procedure to prevent embolization. Removal of the IVC filter is contraindicated unless all clot is cleared.(Sheth et al. 2015; Teter et al. 2019)\n\n\n\n18.2.3.2 Surgery\nSo clot burden reduction techniques are a hot topic at the moment. Before we talk about endovenous techniques, is there a role for surgical venous thrombectomy? And when would you consider this?\nOpen thrombectomy is part of the spectrum of early thrombus removal techniques. It used to be very popular, a very satisfying technique—I think I’ve done it three times. They’ve all been for the same sort of indication, which is phlegmasia, severe limb threatening post DVT change, and in a patient where they weren’t candidates for thrombolysis. However, if you’re with a patient where the leg is threatened, you can’t anticoagulate them, you can’t thrombolize them. Then in that case this is a sort of last ditch approach. But if that’s not the case, then almost always a catheter based approach is less invasive and more acceptable.\nIn addition, most people have got more training. Trainees should read some of the descriptions of open thrombectomy— it’s a very satisfying technique, but it’s quite involved. It involves finding and exposing the common femoral, deep femoral and femoral veins, applying tight compression around the lower leg to milk the clots out distally to proximally. So the original descriptions are really interesting, but really very rarely would we need to do that.(Comerota and Aziz 2019)\n\n\n18.2.3.3 Endovascular\nSo you’ve mentioned catheter directed techniques for clot burden reduction. Some recent trials have challenged our thinking on the appropriateness of these techniques, such as the ATTRACT and the CaVent trial. What’s your take on the current evidence?\nThis is very controversial. The fundamental issue here is that the trials that have been done almost certainly would not have included a large number of people who would benefit from interventions in the opinion of the investigators. So if somebody has got severe DVT, it is unlikely, particularly in the US, where the ATTRACT trial was done, but these people would have been randomized into the trial.\nSo the immediate criticism of the trials is that this is not reflective of the population. You’ve excluded the people that benefit, so it’s an underestimate of the benefit of the technique. But if we look at trial results ourselves, there is a modest benefit. In the CaVent trial, PTS rate was reduced. The quality of life was less impressive, but the PTS rate was reduced moderately.(Haig et al. 2016) And in the ATTRACT trial, when they subgroup analyzed the iliofemoral DVT group, then there was a reduction in the number of people who develop moderate and severe PTS. So I think the numbers are something along the lines of, you’d have to treat 10 people with thrombus removal to prevent one person developing moderate to severe PTS.(Vedantham et al. 2017)\nSo then the discussion is are those numbers needed to treat appropriate for intervention? Particularly when you then start to consider the additional need for stenting and long-term surveillance, et cetera. So I think the jury is very much out. You’ve got really stark, strong, firmly held unshiftable views on both sides of the argument and what we need is a bit of nuance. What we need is everyone accepts that some people benefit let’s all work together, try and work out, which people benefit. Let’s work on case selection.\nSo we’ll put you on the spot then, when would you offer thrombolysis? Which patients would you offer it in and which circumstances would you also stent?\nThere’s no role for thrombolysis in anything other than the iliofemoral segment. So if it’s infrainguinal, proximal DVT, even if its severely symptomatic, the studies that actually you cause harm by attempting early thrombus removal. That’s the first important point.\nEven if they have got severe symptoms, there’s always a role for initial conservative management, compression with elevation and a lot of these people have a dramatic improvement in their symptoms. If they don’t, and there’s an honest discussion, and the bleeding risk is low then potentially there is a role. But when there’s a treatment with a borderline benefit or the benefit is unclear, then I think what we’ve gotta do pick low risk patients, so low bleeding risk. We’ve got to choose teams and techniques with the highest risk of technical success. And we’ve got to pick people where we think the benefit is greatest, i.e. those that have the highest risk of PTS.\nWhether or not you stent is very difficult. We had a case not so long ago where we had a very nice result from early thrombus removal, we stented, and the patients thrombosed again early and subsequently was identified to have triple positive antiphospholipid syndrome. Obviously there wasn’t the opportunity in the time to make that diagnosis prior to the decisions around the thrombus removal, so you end up stung and now this patient has a stent and can be very difficult to open up again. The advocates and the aggressive stenters would say, you can’t leave a significant stenosis after thrombus removal, otherwise they will rethrombose. Whereas others will say, if we go back to the early studies, like CaVent, very few, if any, people actually had stents, but actually their results were still reasonable.\nI think once you get on the roller coaster of thrombus removal, it’s very difficult not to then proceed also to stenting, if you see a significant lesion, for example, at the May-Thurner point.(Wang et al. 2018; Meissner et al. 2012; Rollo et al. 2017) Final comment, I’ll make is that the use of recanalization and stenting for chronic PTS is a very effective technique. So another approach, if you’re not sure, is to manage them conservatively, but always have that up your sleeve, if they get significant PTS at six months, no earlier, then we could potentially consider recanalizing and stenting at that point.\nFollowing thrombolysis, what duration of anticoagulation is required?\nSo the whole point of anticoagulation after DVT is to reduce the risk of propagation and pulmonary embolus, firstly, but also then to reduce the risk of recurrent VTE. The aims don’t really change if you thrombolyzed or if you put a stent in. Some people used to say, I put a stent in, we’ve treated the May-Thurner and that was the main cause of DVT, so we can stop the anticoagulation. That’s not the case. So it shouldn’t change and it shouldn’t be any shorter if you’ve thrombolize and put a stent in.\nNow, whether it should be longer because you put a stent in that’s debatable. Some people have very aggressive anticoagulation protocols after stenting, but that’s to do with the stent rather than the DVT. So remember the aims, which are to reduce the risk of recurrent DVT and PE and to stop propagation of the current event."

    "text": "18.3 Phlegmasia\nSome patients may present with very profound, lower limb swelling. Pain and cyanosis with a threat to viability of the limb. Can you explain for us what phlegmasia is and an approach to treatment?\nThere’s two sorts phlegmasia that are described, but to be honest, I don’t think anybody has a detailed and robust understanding of what these actually mean. Phelgmasia alba dolens is the white leg, cerulea dolens is the blue leg and the severe, form a phlegmasia. Theoretically, cerulea dolens has a limb loss rate of 30-40%--severe limb threat, compartment syndrome, skin blistering, swelling, etc. The reality is that it’s often over-diagnosed, so you’ll see a lot of people saying I did venous thrombolysis for phlegmasia and it’s just a big swollen engorged leg.\nThe reason it happens is almost certainly a profound obstruction of venous outflow. So the venous blood in the leg cannot escape. You get this cycle of worsening pressure, leaking of fluid from the capillaries, increasing pressure on the soft tissues. Then that starts to threaten tissue perfusion and potentially if it’s bad enough this will threaten the actual arterial profusion of the leg as well. Presentation often includes iliofemoral DVT with non-palpable pulses and loss of sensation with out improvement on anticoagulation and elevation. Endovascular early thrombus removal is the first line with fasciotomies, with open thrombectomy as back up for salvage.(Erdoes et al. 2011; Thomas, Hollingsworth, and Mofidi 2019)\nSo that’s the sort of most severe and extreme form. I don’t think anybody has confidently linked the anatomical findings and features of a DVT to what the leg looks like. There was a patient I saw who literally had every deep vein acutely thrombosed from the IVC down to both lower legs and was almost asymptomatic. So we’ve got this very uncomfortable lack of understanding between the symptoms and the clinical and anatomical pattern of DVT."

    "section": "18.4 Deep Venous Obstruction",
    "text": "18.4 Deep Venous Obstruction\n\n18.4.1 Etiology\nSo finally, let’s move on to talk about the treatment of proximal deep venous insufficiency, both obstruction and incompetence. What are the common causes for deep venous obstruction? Thinking about post-thrombotic and non-thrombotic obstructions.\nSo again, the terminology is important. So it’s venous outflow obstruction. Obstruction implies that there’s a physiological issue causing the consequences. As opposed to occlusion, which is an anatomical term. So venous outflow obstruction, is essentially anything that reduces the ability of venous blood to escape the leg via deep venous channels will cause an obstruction.\nAnd again, going back to a bit of physiology. Poiseuille’s Law talks about the flow rate being proportional to the fourth power of the radius. So it’s really interesting. A question to ask is that if you’ve got a two centimeter vein, how many, one centimeter veins would it take to carry the same potential flow as a single two centimeter vein?\nThe long story short is that it takes 16 one centimeter veins to carry the same amounts of potential flow as a single two centimeter vein. So it doesn’t take much of a narrowing to have a great potential impact on flow. Of course, most of the time, you don’t need that flow potential, it’s only an absolute extremes of circulatory stress that you’ll need that sort of potential, but it is interesting. And again, it also challenges when people say there’s great collaterals and that will be enough. Well unless they’re enormous, you need 16 of them to have the same potential blood carrying capacity.\nSo in terms of the causes, the most common by far is post-thrombotic disease. So when you’ve had a DVT, one of three things happens. If you’re lucky, the vein will recanalize completely. If you’re unlucky, it will obstruct completely. And if you’re somewhere in between, you’ll end up with partial stenosis and obstruction. What’s important is even if the vein is open, what you almost always lose in the post-thrombotic vein is venous compliance. It’s not the same compliant vein that can respond to demands and physiological need that you have, in a primary non-scarred vein.\nOther potential causes are a non-thrombotic iliac vein lesion, or May-Thurner lesion. So the original paper, 1957, is very interesting reading.(May and Thurner 1957) There were a couple of Austrian pathologists who identified that a very high proportion of people, particularly those had left-sided DVT had, not only the overriding iliac artery causing compression, but they had a secondary tight fibrosis in the iliac vein.(Nazzal et al. 2015) So it’s not just the compression because any one of us in a certain position we’ll have a squashed vein. It’s the fact that there’s a secondary inflammatory fibrotic change, which is what’s causing the obstruction. So that’s a true May-Thurner or non-thrombotic lesion.(Liddell and Evans 2018; Rollo et al. 2017)\nThe other big group of patients of course, is malignant lymph node or retroperitoneal fibrosis related venous outflow obstruction. For example, a patient with a large retroperitoneal leiomyosarcoma may be involving the vena cava. In this case, these patients may require en bloc resection of the IVC and reconstruction with ringed PTFE, sized off the preoperative imaging.(Quinones-Baldrich et al. 2012; Fiore et al. 2012) But in the end, post-thrombotic by far was the most commonly diagnosed pathology.\n\n\n18.4.2 Evaluation\nWe may see patients who come in with severe venous disease with skin changes, for example. When would you consider imaging the proximal deep veins in addition to infrainguinal superficial and deep veins of the leg and what are the best modalities to do this?\nSo we are really getting down to the importance of a detailed assessment of the entire superficial and deep venous system. Every patient with venous disease should have a whole leg infrainguinal duplex to start with—that’s deep and superficial veins. There’s no real role for just looking at superficial veins. So you need to understand the context. In terms of if their obstructed or if they’re refluxing. Again, remember that, reflux on a duplex, yes, all we see is arrows going in certain directions. But all reflux means is that after a calf augmentation maneuver, there is some retrograde flow—in a superficial vein, more than half a second and in a deep vein, more than one second. That’s all it means. So for example, you can have retrograde flow for 0.6 seconds in a saphenous vein, and that will be labeled as reflux for all the rest of the time that superficial vein is doing the right job, it’s returning the blood to the heart. So just be wary of interpreting what these arrows mean. For more, see Section 20.7.\nIn terms of how that affects your decision-making—one approach is to consider the overall burden of venous disease, such as those with venous hypertension. And what I try and do is draw a pie chart and say, you got venous hypertension, here are the different causes of your venous disease—that might include superficial reflux, deep venous reflux, deep venous obstruction, and other factors. You try and apply some clinical judgment as to what the different factors are.\nNow, even if they’ve got significant, deep venous reflux and superficial venous reflux, there is still a role for treating superficial reflux in most of these cases. I still come across colleagues and other people who say, look, you shouldn’t treat the superficial veins if there’s deep reflux. But all the studies—EVRA, ESCHAR--have shown significant benefits, even if there’s deep flux.(Manjit S. Gohel et al. 2007; Manjit S. Gohel et al. 2018) So again, the key message is treat the superficial reflux if it’s there. However, if the patient has isolated deep reflux then management is limited to wound care and compression, often as high as 40-50mmHg. Some series have found that 70-80% will heal.(O’Donnell et al. 2014; Maleti and Perrin 2011)\nNow, deep venous obstruction and looking for it is a different matter. There are again, lots of approaches, some people are very aggressive about evaluating the iliac veins—CTVs and IVUS on everybody. The problem is if you get super aggressive, then you start to over-diagnose and if you start to over-diagnose, you start to over treat and this all gets very messy.\nI think the sort of people that have clear signs and symptoms of major venous outflow obstruction, particularly venous claudication, history of previous DVT, really disproportionate venous changes to the superficial and the infrainguinal imaging. Proximal obstruction can present with atypical proximal varicose veins in the mons pubis, perineum, buttock, high posterior/lateral thigh, abdominal wall. These findings are 93% predictive of deep venous obstruction proximal to the inguinal ligament.(Kurstjens et al. 2016) Those are the people that I would image.\nAnd on the duplex imaging of the leg, if there are changes in the common femoral vein that make you think there is a proximal problem, particularly a loss of phasicity of flow then that’s pretty concerning for a significant venous outflow problem. In an unobstructed venous system, the common femoral vein should really reflect the right hearts, which has some phasicity. There should be transmission of that respiratory phasicity. So if that isn’t there, then you’re thinking, hang on, there’s something interrupting that transmission, which is almost always an obstruction somewhere. So those are the people I’d image, but I wouldn’t over image—because then you end up with a headache and a problem—Should I treat or should I not treat?\nSo you mentioned IVUS, what is intravascular ultrasound and what are the particular benefits of using this technique over venography alone?\nIVUS is a 9F probe that is inserted into the vein and it gives you a 360 degree view in B-mode ultrasound—traditionally without color flow, just B mode—of the anatomical structures. What it’s very useful for is identifying venous anatomy, confluences, identifying the size of veins, so it allows you to plan sizes of stents. It really is an important adjunct to venography and other imaging modalities. We did our first 30 or so cases of deep venous stenting without IVUS and thought we were brilliant and IVUS was a waste of money. And then we started using IVUS and realized I can’t believe we were doing this without. Once you start using it, you suddenly realize that it’s a really useful adjunct. Recommended oversizing for vein stenting is 10-15% of largest diameter of adjacent vein.(Gloviczki et al. 2011; O’Donnell et al. 2014; Raju, Owen, and Neglen 2002; Raju, Darcey, and Neglén 2010)\nIn terms of when you use it, in some parts of the world it’s commonly used for diagnostic purposes, but beware of the risk of over-diagnosis. More commonly, almost routinely, IVUS is used for therapeutic, particularly when we’re stenting deep veins to plan our landing zones. When CTA/MRA shows compression, it must be confirmed with IVUS prior to treatment. IVUS has far greater sensitivity and specificity and must show a cross-sectional surface area reduction of greater than 50%.(Gagne et al. 2018; Forauer et al. 2002)\nYou talked about over-diagnosis. Can you talk us through some of the decision-making processes that you go through when you’re assessing a patient who has a deep venous obstruction?\nThere are lots of patients that have this anatomical change, the number of referrals I get from people who have done a CT and they’ve picked up a problem. The most important thing is the clinical status and the clinical picture. So have they got symptoms—go about right at the beginning of the podcast—have they got symptoms? Have they got complications? If they haven’t got significant symptoms and they haven’t got significant complications then there’s not really an indication for treatments.\nSo leg swelling was initially, frequently pushed as, oh you’re swelling will get better, if we get rid of your obstruction. That’s only the case in probably less than 50% of patients. The reason for that is that, yes the original etiology for the swelling may well have been venous, but you almost always get a secondary lymphatic dysfunction when you’ve had swelling, for whatever reason—whether it’s heart failure, whether it’s venous, the lymphatic system gets damaged. And so even if you get rid of the original cause, the lymphatic damage persists, of course, and the swelling persists.\nThe symptoms are very important and in terms of complications, if somebody has intractable ulceration, et cetera, these are all important indications. But a bit of skin change, a bit of mild swelling, careful case selection is very important for these procedures.\n\n\n18.4.3 Management\n\n18.4.3.1 Endovascular\nThere is variability in the availability of stents for venous obstruction. However, closed cell braided stents (i.e. the Wallstent) have been around for many years and has the most data related to long term durability.(Gagne et al. 2019) These stents have the least radial force at the ends, so it is recommended to extent 1-2cm beyond the venous obstruction. In cases of proximal iliac vein obstruction, this may require extending into the IVC 1-2cm which may cross, or “jail” the contralateral iliac vein. When jailed, the rate of DVT on that side has been reported as high as 10%.(Murphy et al. 2017; Le et al. 2018)\nSo following a deep venous recanalization and stenting, what surveillance do you offer for these patients?\nSurveillance has been evolving. The first availability CE (UK version of FDA) marked deep venous stents in the UK was around 2012. A few services across the country really got started at a few centers in 2012, 2013. Initially there was an early scan and then a scan maybe at six weeks and three or six months down the line.\nI think we realized that in general, the people that developed problems, often develop them very early. So we are scanning these people the day after the intervention—obviously there’s intraoperative quality control and venograms and scanning—but the day after the intervention to ensure that there’s no early thrombus problems. Then we scan a couple of weeks after to make sure that there’s nothing that’s happened early, because there’s an opportunity to re-intervene, to balloon, to correct any technical issues, at that point. After that point, it’s usually six weeks, three months, six months, and then annually thereafter.\nSo that’s a sort of protocol that we have and in general, what we’ve seen is that people that develop problems tend to develop them relatively early. So once you get to a year, then in general, the patency rates are very good. In our center, the the chronic PTS stenting primary patency rates at around three years are over 80%-85%. Of course, there are some that have problems, but it’s important to remember that, even those that have thrombosed, they generally go back to the level of symptoms they have prior to intervention. Which is very reassuring. The last thing you want to do is to make people worse with a novel intervention.\nAnd so what about your anticoagulation and antiplatelet regime for these patients?\nThere was a systematic review done a few years ago where all of the published literature for deep venous stenting was reviewed and I think the authors identified 28 different regimens for anticoagulation of the stenting.(Notten, Ten Cate, and Ten Cate-Hoek 2021) The honest answer is nobody knows, our approach is to have low molecular weight heparin as the primary anticoagulant for the initial two week period. And then at the two week point, they undergo a stent. If there’s no issues, they get transitioned to a DOAC.\nIn addition, the patients get six weeks of clopidogrel as an anti-platelet. And again, the reason for that is that it’s a foreign material into the vein. Yes, the role of anti-platelets in preventing venous thrombosis is very limited but there has to be some platelet related activity and platelet activation involved there. So it makes logical sense to have some anti-platelet activity. Of course the downside is that there’s an increasing bleeding risk. These are the constant tightropes that you’re walking with these patients.\n\n\n18.4.3.2 Surgery\nWe’ve talked about endovascular and endovenous treatments, but is there a role for open surgery in these patients?\nSo in the iliac segment, very rarely. In some patients, you can do PTFE reconstructions and bypasses. And of course the traditional operations of Palma-Dale(Palma and Esperon 1960) bypass and May-Husni(Shaydakov, Porembskaya, and Geroulakos 2015) type procedures. They all sounded very elegant in the books, but the reality is a great saphenous vein going across the lower abdomen to the other side is not really going to sort the problem out in a durable way for all sorts of obvious reasons—the size of the vein, the pressure and all that sort of stuff. So there’s really very limited role for those sorts of procedures.\nNow, the one area where there may be a role for open reconstruction is in the common femoral vein. The consistent observation is that good inflow is absolutely imperative to get good outcomes in these patients. And sometimes if the common femoral vein has got a lot of scarring, then it’s very difficult to reconstruct that inflow endovascularly. So a number of authors have advocated the use of endophlebectomy, opening up the common femoral vein, and cutting out the scarring and the tribulations, putting a patch on it. Sometimes even putting an AV fistula—a little six millimeter graph from the common femoral artery onto the vein to really drive the flow through the stent. It’s a pretty complicated operation and you can imagine you’re dissecting down and there’s lots of little veins everywhere and lots of lymphatics. The wound complication rate is very high.\nSo really very limited role only—the endovascular approach is really the way forward for these patients."

    "text": "18.5 Pelvic Congestive Syndrome\n\n18.5.1 Presentation\nSo finally, let’s talk about pelvic congestion syndrome. What is pelvic congestion syndrome and how does it present?\nSo it often doesn’t present anywhere near a vascular surgeon. There are a number of women who present with these chronic heaviness and dragging symptoms in the lower abdomen. There may be some association with menses, there’s often dyspareunia and a whole variety of other symptoms.\nThere may be associated vulvar varices or posterior buttock and thigh varices all as a result of pelvic venous incompetence. Knowing the proximal anatomy of the saphenous vein tributaries is important, as the pudendal vein tributary connects vulvar veins and inferior gluteal vein connects to the posterior buttock.(Iafrati and Donnell 2019) But it’s a complicated field—there are some people that have pelvic symptoms, there are some people that have the varicose veins or some will have a combination of the two. Almost always they will be seen and initially assessed by the gynecology teams rather than coming to the vascular surgeons.\n\n\n18.5.2 Evaluation and Management\nWhen we do see these patients, are there any treatment options available for them? And when would you consider treating?\nIn a highly selective way—this is venous disease in a nutshell—the association between anatomical changes and clinical symptoms is ropey at best. In terms of postpartum women, an enormous proportion of these women have got venous reflux in the pelvis—if you look hard enough. so the problem is similar to that of May-Thurner syndrome, if you start looking hard enough, you start identifying these symptoms and then you lose the ability to really discern who’s going to benefit most.\nSo again, I would go back to clinical symptoms as the single most important thing. If they’ve got severe clinical symptoms majorly affecting their quality of life and associated significant venous changes, then those people to try to intervene on. It’s not necessarily a benign procedure. Pelvic vein embolization involves implantation of coils. There’s concerns about non-targeted embolization as coils have ended up in lungs. There are a number of people with unknown nickel allergies that have problems with these coils. So again, it’s not an area to be over aggressive. So careful case selection is important. So again, a quick plug for the ESVS guidelines. There is a very good section on pelvic venous disease assessment.(De Maeseneer et al. 2022)\nWhat’s very important is again, to differentiate between pelvic congestion syndrome and pelvic origin varicosities. One thing that is certainly being advocated is that if the varicose veins are coming from the pelvis, but there’s no pelvic congestion syndrome, it’s perfectly reasonable just to deal with the visible varicosities from below—with some foam sclerotherapy or other treatment from below, rather than being super aggressive embolizing from above. But I think anybody who’s involved in managing this really needs to work closely with the gynecologists. There are gynecological diagnoses that need excluding before we start to address the venous disease. And there are a number of validated questionnaires and other assessment tools that are probably quite important. So not for the faint-hearted."

Causes of secondary lymphedema include filariasis, which is endemic to parts of South America.(Pfarr et al. 2009; Shenoy 2008)\n\n\n18.8.1.2 Presentation\nThe management of lymphedema is determined primarily on its clinical stage at presentation.(Grada and Phillips 2017) The staging for lymphedema is as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLymphedema Stage\nDescription\nSymptoms\n\n\n\n\n0\nSub-clinical\nNo swelling, heaviness or discomfort\n\n\n1\nSpontaneous Reversible\nSwelling improved with limb elevation\n\n\n2\nSpontaneous Irreversible\nPitting and swelling, not improved with elevation\n\n\n3\nLymphostatic elephantiasis\nSkin hardening, non-pitting edema, verrucas changes, recurrent infection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18.8.2 Evaluation\nOn physical exam, a classic finding is Stemmer’s sign, which is a thickened skin fold at the based of the second toe/finger. The sign is positive when the tissue is hardened and cannot be lifted.(S. G. Rockson et al. 1998; Stanley G. Rockson 2019)\nLymphedema is most often diagnosed based on clinical presentation and physical exam. Lymphoscintography can be used to confirm the diagnosis in complex presentations and would demonstrate dermal back flow, absent or delayed transport, crossover filling, absent or delayed visualization of lymph beds.(Stanley G. Rockson 2019; O’Donnell, Rasmussen, and Sevick-Muraca 2017)\n\n\n18.8.3 Management\nTreatment is best initially managed with combined decongestive therapy (CDT) which includes an intensive reductive phase (4-8wks), followed by life long maintenance, often with specific compression garments.(Grada and Phillips 2017) CDT in the setting of heart failure has been reported to lead to volume overload.(Lawenda, Mondry, and Johnstone 2009)\nIn extreme cases, after CDT therapy has been instituted for at least 6 months and the patient has persistent refractory symptoms, surgery may be used for reconstruction or debulking.(Grada and Phillips 2017; Baumeister et al. 2016)\n\n\n\n\nAgnelli, Giancarlo, Cecilia Becattini, Guy Meyer, Andres Muñoz, Menno V.

Could you explain this concept?\nIf I had to take one tool with me into resuscitation room or an austere location to evaluate for vascular injury, it would be the continuous wave Doppler. It’s only more powerful if you can combine it with a manual blood pressure cuff and together allow one to obtain an objective measure of perfusion. One can slowly inflate the blood pressure cuff, just proximal to the arterial signal, kind of like taking a blood pressure, and measure the pressure at which the arterial signal goes away. That can then be compared to a normal or non-injured extremity. If there is no flow limiting arterial injury, the ratio should be one or slightly greater than one.\nConversely, if the ratio for the injured extremity is less than 0.9, then that’s indicative of flow limiting injury in the artery to that extremity. If the patient happens to be in shock or cold and clamped down, the injured extremity index can be repeated 10 or 15 minutes later as the patient is resuscitated and warmed.(Rasmussen and Tai 2022)\nSo what do you think the role of CTA is in the workup of extremity with concern for vascular trauma?\nIf there are hard signs of arterial injury, oftentimes the patient will require an intervention without obtaining formal imaging. The question about imaging often comes into play when there’s a soft sign of vascular injury, such as a reduced injury extremity index, audible bruit, or injury pattern. We spent decades saying that the traditional arteriography was the gold standard, but I think we can say now that CTA has become the gold standard for the evaluation of extremity vascular injury. CTA has improved in quality and it can also get imaging of the head, torso, or other other extremities.\nAnd so whether the patient has a hard sign or a soft sign with a vascular injury, can you talk us through some of the principles of operating on peripheral vascular trauma?\nForemost important is to resuscitate the patient and to be mindful of his or her physiology and hemodynamics. As we said, an extremity vascular injury can be somewhat distracting. Make sure the patient is being resuscitated and warmed, ventilator settings are being corrected, and monitoring is in place – which takes a lot of communication with the anesthesia team, the circulating nurse, the technicians, and the blood bank.\nI think once the patient is set and you have the team resuscitating him or her, then you can turn your attention to the injured extremity. I will prep that patient widely and be mindful that the incision is likely to take more than what you think it will. For example, for an above the knee popliteal artery, I will still prep that patient from their umbilicus down to both legs; because you need to anticipate getting proximal control, or doing an angiogram at the femoral artery level and anticipate the potential harvesting of saphenous vein for conduit.\nI also leave the tourniquet on and just prep it into the case. Taking that tourniquet down prematurely can be problematic for a couple of reasons. It may result in arterial bleeding, which in itself can be catestrophic, but it can also result in hypotension which poses risk to multiple organ systems. So, I just prep them into the field and then communicate with anesthesia to tell them when I am going to let this tourniquet down. Prior to doing so, I ensure they are ready, they have blood going, and have a secondary measure to control bleeding as you let that tourniquet down.\nFor the incisions, they just need to be probably twice as long as you think they do. You can’t fix what you can’t see and if you can’t see it, you can’t control it, and you certainly can’t repair it.\nDo you routinely heparinize all these patients?\nI hate to equivocate, but it depends. It depends on whether or not they have other injuries. So if it’s an isolated extremity injury and the patient does not have any torso bleeding, head trauma, or very extensive soft tissue injury, then I will then be more inclined to use systemic heparin during revascularization. If they have any of the above injuries, then I will use regional heparin flushed up and down the injured vessel.(Liang et al. 2016; Fox et al. 2012)\nOne question that I’ve heard come up a handful of times is can you use saphenous vein from the injured extremity?\nOur teaching, as you referenced, has always been to use a saphenous vein from the contralateral extremity, but I am quite practical about it. I certainly have used ipsilateral saphenous vein. If there’s no deep vein injury and it’s part of the incision and exposure, then I will use ipsilateral reversed greater saphenous vein. If there is concern for deep venous injury or if I have another person to harvest and who can prep the other leg, then often I’ll defer to that and use contralateral. I’ll be more deferential to using the contralateral saphenous vein in the reverse configuration.(Liang et al. 2016; Fox et al. 2012)\nSo you have a vascular injury and you have debride it back to healthy tissue. How do you make the decision between, primary repair, patch repair, or interposition graft with autologous vein or prosthetic?\nYou know, you can picture it now, you have vascular control with clamp proximal and distal. Now you’re setting up, you are really shifting gears into a different phase of this operation. It’s important to just take a deep breath, I think at this point, and check with anesthesia and make sure the patient’s doing all right from a global standpoint.\nI think the other thing is that at this point, I have sometimes overlooked the importance of performing a proximal and distal thrombectomy using the Fogarty catheter. I’ll make sure that I’ve passed a Fogarty catheter distally to completely clear the outflow of thrombus. Then I’ll use regional heparin, 40-60cc of heparin saline down the outflow before I apply the clamp. I’ll do the same in the inflow and that buys you a little time as you’re sort of thinking about and sizing up what’s in front of you.(Liang et al. 2016; Fox et al. 2012)\nI think in my experience, the majority of patients need an interposition graft. Certainly, if it’s a grazing wound or a stab wound from a knife, there may be a role for primary repair or patch. But if one thinks there’s going to be any compromise of the arterial lumen or tension on the repair, then you’re better off with an interposition. (Liang et al. 2016; Fox et al. 2012)\nThere are some special cases where primary repair might be appropriate. Veins are much more compliant and you can often get away with a lateral venorrhaphy. Then sometimes the upper extremities, such as the brachial artery, has more redundancy. If it’s a very focal injury and you can get a little stretch, then you will often be able to get the brachial artery back together primarily. Of note, upper extremity disability can have a significant impact on quality of life. Long term functional impairment is measured by the Disabilities of Arm, Should, Hand (DASH) questionnaire. Impairment most closely associated with duration and severity of ischemia and concomitant nerve injury (36%). Open reconstruction preferred, patency rates are high.(Frech et al. 2016)\nI suspect in the majority of my experience, vascular injuries require an interposition graft. Then in regards to conduit, because most of the wartime injuries were contaminated and quite dirty, we deferred to autologous saphenous vein the vast majority of the time. However, if you are in a pinch, can’t find vein or don’t have time to harvest vein, the wound isn’t too contaminated, and the injury is proximal, axillary or subclavian, proximal femoral, or iliac, then I think using a prosthetic, either Dacron or expanded PTFE Gore-Tex is also acceptable. Some recent civilian literature says PTFE may be better than vein, but that has not been our experience in the deployed setting.\nNow that we have covered some basic principles, lets dive in a little deeper on each kind of peripheral vascular injury. First we’re going to talk about junctional hemorrhage, which is an injury in the junctional area between the torso and extremity, such as the distal external iliac/common femoral or subclavian/axillary region. These are some our biggest fears and most difficult to deal with. Can you take us through a hematoma in the groin or pelvis just above inguinal ligament–what are the best ways to get control of this?\nFor the iliac artery or even just the proximal common femoral, I think a retroperitoneal exposure to the lower quadrant of the abdomen is preferred. We sometimes refer to that as a transplant incision, which is quite suitable depending upon the injury pattern.\nAs I alluded to before, don’t underestimate the exposure you’re going to need. So, if it truly is a groin hematoma, think that this could be common femoral or external iliac and in those cases, either a transplant incision in a retroperitoneal fashion to get that controlled up to the common iliac, or just doing a laparotomy and finding it through the abdomen would suffice.\nWhat if you encountered an internal iliac injury deep in the pelvis that you weren’t able to control, what are the consequences of ligating that?\nThat’s real tiger country, in those cases it’s really damaged control. One of the things we haven’t mentioned is the important tenant – that maybe arguably is one of the most important tenants in vascular damage control – is ligation. We’ve talked a lot about setting up for a vascular repair, but one of the reasons to check with anesthesia and to assess the whole of the patient is to recognize that in some scenarios the best thing is ligation and then dealing with whatever consequences may result from that.\nKeeping in mind, the idea of life over limb and not being too aggressive about trying to do some sort of exposure and repair of a vessel that takes hours and many, many units of blood. So in that context, I think, if you find bleeding from the internal iliac or hypogastric vessels, I think ligating those is quite acceptable. There can be instances of pelvic ischemia, but if the contralateral iliac artery is open, then that’s quite rare.\nAlso, often one is dealing with artery and vein injury because they’re right there together. And as I mentioned, that’s real tiger country. If that’s happening in those situations, keep in mind the tenants of exposure, light, two suctions, and don’t use too small of a needle. That’s where the SH blunt tip needle on a 3-0 or 4-0 prolene needle works well. Don’t try to be too finesse about this because, in the pelvis, you won’t be able to see your needle.\nLet’s take the same injury and move it now to the external iliac–what are the consequences of ligating the external iliac artery and what are some of your options?\nBecause it’s the axial vessel to that extremity, I would not ligate the external iliac artery with such impunity. I think in those situations, controlling it and making that assessment of whether or not to repair it is paramount. I think that the consequences of ligating an external iliac artery are going to be significant and include proximal extremity ischemia, including thigh, and probable need for above the knee amputation and even disarticulation of the hip.\nSo I think the external iliac needs to be preserved at all costs. And whether you reconstruct immediately or use a temporary vascular shunt as a damage control is dependent upon how the patient’s doing or if you are in the field and there are other triage concerns.\nSome can find shunts a little tricky, can you give some advice to listeners on how to best use temporary vascular shunts for damage control?\nI think it’s important to know what shunts you have available before you are in this situation. So stroll through the operating room or your stock room, wherever you are, when it’s not busy and check out the stock of shunts. There are four or five different types of shunts, anything from what’s referred to as the Javid shunt, Sundt shunt, or there’s the Argyle shunt. Then there can be makeshift shunts, such as small caliber chest tubes, which are temporary plastic tubes that can be placed into the injured vessel proximally, and then controlled with either a ligature around the vessel to lock that shunt place or a rubber vessel loop.\nAnd then you want to make sure that you did not blow out any clot with that shunt. So you let some heartbeats go with red blood running through the shunt, then occlude it with the clamp, and then insert it to the vessel that is distal to the injury.\nLikewise, you have to make sure that the thrombus has been removed, and I mentioned this earlier from that distal vessel. I think it is very important before you place the shunt in that you try to clear as much of the thrombus as you can, proximal and distal, and then place that shunt in and secure it either with a heavy silk tie or plastic vessel loops.\nMost of those shunts you can listen with the Doppler and you will see arterial flow in it. So you can listen on the surface of the plastic shunt with a little water or acoustic gel and hear the arterial flow in those shunts.\nFor our military docs out there, if they’re deploying to a role and their supply sergeant calls them and asks what kind of shunts do you want us to have — what sizes and what types? What recommendations would you give to make sure that you have them on hand?\nYeah, it’s a great question for now and it’s a challenge for us in the future. I think here and now, I would try to really make sure that the surgeon put his or her hands on Argyle shunts. The Argyle shunts come four in a container, there’s a 12 French, 14 French, 10 French, and an 8 French all sort of in the same container. And its important to make sure he has those. As the larger 14 French Argyle can work on an iliac. So that would be one, and another would be to look for a 14 French chest tube. And I would say, “so these are my shunt options and I would need to have these available.”\nThe other shunts, the Sundt and Javid shunts, are the other ones you could ask for, but then you only have one size for those. And so those and the thrombectomy catheters is what I would have. Because I think it’s very difficult to do an effective arterial repair without the ability to do the thrombectomy, proximal and distal, because you will be repairing that segment into thrombosed vessel with thrombosed inflow and thrombosed outflow.\nI think you have to get that vascular repair kit, if you will, assembled and communicated with your scrub team ahead of time, so as to include the specifics of each item: specific heparin saline dose, shunts to be used, SH needle and some of the smaller ones, and thrombectomy catheters. It is important to go through that series of tools that you may find yourself needing. Also, keep in mind, we don’t use pulmonary artery catheters as much anymore, but they can be used as a thrombectomy catheter in a pinch. And then those thrombectomy catheters can be used as good proximal inflow control. You can insert a large thrombectomy catheter proximal and inflate the balloon with a three-way stopcock and that will afford you inflow control in a pinch as well.\nSay you’re having a patient transferred in from the Role II to the higher level of care. Do you recommend these patients be heparinized, if able, when they have shunts whether arterial or venous\nIf they can be, then yes. It is dependent on whether there are other injuries to the head, torso, extensive soft tissue, etc. If there is massive bleeding, then the recommendation is to not shunt or put these patients on heparin.\nThe best anticoagulant is flow. If you have high flow in those larger proximal vessels (above the knee or elbow), the shunts will stay patent without heparin (typically for 4-6 hours). The distal shunts, if they do clot off, what we have found is that they do not cause harm when they clot off. You basically are just back to square one with the occluded vessel and you have to do the thrombectomy, assessment, and repairs.\nSo even if the shunts do thrombose, our experience has been – at least in the short term of the temporary shunts – that in two, four, five, six hours they do not cause harm when they thrombose. You just have to do the thrombectomy and assessment at that time.\nTo close out iliac artery injuries, if you did need to ligate either the common or external iliac artery due to severe injury, what kind of options do you have there?\nWell, that all really depends on the patient and their overall condition. If you have found yourself not being able to put a shunt in and in that scenario you had to ligate the external iliac, that patients is presumably in a really bad situation.\nYou can ligate it temporarily. So thinking that I am going to ligate it and then get some help. But in 2-3 hours, I am going t o have to go back and try to re-establish inline flow with another set of hands, with more blood, a different surgeon, different lighting, different tools, because leaving it ligated will incur a tremendous amount of ischemia into that extremity.\nThere are the options of a cross femoral graft. I don’t think I have ever done that in the setting of trauma, bringing a PTFE graft from the other groin, the other femoral artery over to the injured femoral artery. That would be extraordinary or unusual. But when the options are just life over limb, and you have to just say: “I can’t repair it.” The scenario, whatever the reason, does not allow me to establish inline flow and the patient’s going to get an amputation and we are going to work on saving his or her life, and move on.\nAs we move our way down the leg, I want to stop and focus on the common femoral and just discuss the principles of controlling the vessel — the options and if ligation is an option at this level for any of the branches? Also, in residency, we would talk about blast injuries and accessing the common femoral to get hemorrhage control. Is this a common maneuver performed in the combat trauma?\nThe common femoral is not much less consequential than the iliac. In fact, it’s probably every bit as consequential, as far as ligating it. So it can be ligated as a damage control maneuver, but the consequences will be significant if ligating the common femoral – just as significant as the external iliac.\nThere’s three femoral arteries: the common, the deep femoral, and the superficial femoral. I think similar to what I mentioned before, all efforts should be maintained to try to maintain or establish flow through those three, if at all possible, and balancing the situation at hand, which sometimes means I have got to ligate it – because of the flow of casualties, because of the capability I have at a given leve. Again, ligation if its life over limb is still an important damage control maneuver. You just have to be ready for the consequences of that and move on.\nSo controlling it, I think the Fogarty catheters are useful to control the deep femoral. Sometimes from the open common, you can insert a small Fogarty down into the orifice of the deep femoral and inflate that balloon and control back bleeding from the profunda. Often there are two profunda femoris arteries. They are difficult to control as they are right adjacent to the deep femoral vein. So, oftentimes controlling those deep femoral vessels from the inside using the small Fogarty and a three-way stopcock is quite handy. Then, the same tenets apply with either placing a shunt and trying to do a primary repair or some sort of interposition repair. If the patient is unstable, then a shunt should be placed and the patient brought back for definitive repair.(Abou Ali et al. 2017; Subramanian et al. 2008)\nThe popliteal artery is an area that we frequently see injuries and they can be quite difficult to manage. Can you discuss just a little bit about how you best expose and set up the patient when you are trying to access the popliteal artery, both above and below the knee.\nYeah, I will. And I skipped a question there. You asked about accessing the common for control. I think that’s acceptable, I mean, it just depends on where the injury is and who is managing the case. I think if it’s an individual who has done, 15 or 20 or 30 of these sorts of cases, and they feel comfortable about accessing the common femoral to control it – I don’t think there’s anything at all wrong with that. On the flip side, if it’s a distal SFA (superficial femoral artery) injury or a popliteal artery injury, in those situations, most of the time it should not require just a virgin cut down on an uninjured common femoral.\nNow for popliteal, I think it is really important to get in-flow control to the popliteal. One has to expose the above knee popliteal artery, which is really the distal segment of the superficial femoral artery as it comes through the adductor magnus or Hunter’s canal.\nYou would start with a wide, long incision from above the knee to the mid thigh. It is important to make sure to have a small sort of bump with rolled towels that are placed underneath the calf, so that you prop the leg up in a “frog leg position” and let gravity pull a lot of the musculature of the leg down. Then, find the the distal superficial femoral which is proximal to the above knee popliteal, just at or beyond Hunter’s canal.\nAnd now move the bump above the knee. Then, make a separate medial incision below the knee, again using sort of gravity in a way to pull the gastrocnemius and soleus down, so that you can open up that below knee popliteal space – you are taking the muscles right down on the medial, inferior edge of the tibia to open up that below the knee popliteal space.\nIn this situation, you are going to need Weitlaner retractors. Oftentimes, we have something called a popliteal retractor, which has different depths of blades on the retractor. That’s also referred to as a Henly popliteal retractor or Pilling retractor (must be the company that makes it). Those are awfully handy because you may need varying depths in blades, deeper than the standard Weitlaner retractor.\nAnd then being able to really put a narrow handheld retractor, like an appendiceal or a Wylie renal vein retractor, that allows you to really retract. If you are above the knee and you are not that well exposed, you can put that narrow handheld on the inferior aspect of the wound and sort of toe in and really get down into the popliteal space itself.\nIf you are below the knee, you put that narrow handheld in the proximal extent and again, toe in and you really can try to get that popliteal space itself exposed. If you need to, you can join the above and below knee incisions – sometimes with the trauma, the injuries are joined anyway. Those are sort of some tenets.\nLastly, lighting. It can not be overstated how important lighting is, sometimes that’s a luxury for those of you who are in a deployed setting. But these are the top line things to think about with popliteal artery exposure.\nFrom one of my own clinical experiences, especially in young patients, with repairing or bypassing the popliteal artery, many times these patients have very severe vasospasm at the end of the case. So that, even though you may do a beautiful bypass, you have minimal Doppler signals in the foot at the conclusion of the case. Have you experienced this and do you have any thoughts on this?\nYeah, for sure. If the bypass has sort of an above knee-to-below knee and you have excluded or ligated the injured popliteal artery, then absolutely, a lot of times the patient will be relatively cold and in a vasoconstrictive condition. As long as you feel like there’s flow in the reverse vein bypass – ie: you can hear audible flow and it’s not a water hammer signal, meaning that there’s some diastolic flow in the arterial signal, and then there’s some sort of weak signal at the ankle – most of the time, I will just be done, warm the patient up, and resuscitate them. If any of those things are not true, you don’t have any arterial signal in the graft, or if you do and it’s only a water hammer signal, or where there’s no signal at all at the foot or beyond the graft – then, you have to open it up. Pass thrombectomy catheters, proximal and distal, and get that regional heparinized saline, and really make sure that there’s not a real problem. But, that’s really a judgment call and it is anxiety-provoking for sure.\nBut you have to have faith. I do think that if you feel like technically you saw all of your stitches, you felt it was good, you had some good outflow back bleeding before you did the distal, you didn’t forget to the thrombectomy proximally, and you have signals – even if they are in spasm and you feel it’s not as good as it should be – in some of those cases, you warm the patient up and resuscitate them and the signal will improve.\nYou can also do an on-the-table angiogram, but that puts you in an austere location and can be a little bit of going down a rabbit hole. You will see the spasm and then say: “well, geez, now i need to intervene on the spasm.” An on-table angiogram is certainly an option and it should not be discounted, but I also would encourage folks that as long as those things are true – you saw your anastomosis, you thrombectomized proximally and distally, you feel good about your inflow/outflow, you have an arterial signal that has got some diastolic flow (not water hammer in the graft), and you have some signal beyond it – warm up the patient and see how they do.\nAs we continue down the leg, we encounter our tibial vessels. How do you decide on repairing tibial vessels versus just ligating them?\nSo there’s a great paper I would refer you and your listeners to that was published in the Journal of Vascular Surgery in 2010 with Gabriel Burkhardt as the lead author.(Burkhardt et al. 2010) It was a review of the U.S. military experience with the practice of selective tibial artery repair. When you think about what that means, selective repair, it means we repair some but not all tibial arteries. So how do you determine which ones to repair? That was a good review article in the Journal of Vascular Surgery that I think looked at maybe a hundred tibial artery injuries. What we found from that experience was some principles of selective repair which led us fix those patients in which all three tibial arteries were injured. This means that it was not just the posterior tibial artery, but because of the injury pattern, the peroneal and anterior tibial had also been severed and there was just no flow in the foot. So in those situations, we did repair them with a reverse saphenous vein graft. That’s the exception. Majority of times, as you are alluding to and in that case series, we did not repair them because we could ligate the single tibial artery injury since there was redundant arterial flow to the foot. So you can ligate it, listen on the table, and if the other tibial vessels are patent then it can remain ligated and should remain ligated because tibial artery repairs are even more technically challenging and time-consuming.\nWe are going to shift our focus to cover venous injuries. What are your thoughts? We have been talking a lot about the possibilities of ligating arterial injuries. How do you approach venous injuries and ligation?\nThis would also fall under the descriptor of selective repair, which means you repair some but not all. Without going into too much detail, it depends. In almost all of the upper extremity veins, can and just should be ligated. There is not enough muscle mass and flow in the upper extremity veins to bother with repair. The exceptions might be a proximal axillary vein or subclavian vein. But, by and large, the distal axillary, brachial, basilic, cephalic veins can be ligated. In the lower extremity, similarly, the small tibial veins can and should be ligated – there should be no attempt to repair those. Coming proximally in the lower extremity, popliteal and then the femoral vein, if the patient is physiologically stable and performing a repair is possible or placing a venous shunt (we have had good luck venous shunts staying patent), then we have deferred to fixing the veins in those cases. If the patient is not in profound shock and if the expertise is there and present to do it with operating time, I think there is benefit to fixing those veins. There have been studies that confirm that this approach affords better arterial flow in the arterial repair because the venous outflow is not impeded.(Quan et al. 2008; Clouse et al. 2007; Rasmussen and Tai 2022) Even if those veins thrombose over time, they do it slowly and do not lead to pulmonary emboli. So, when we can, we will fix those veins in the popliteal and femoral segments. Conversely, if the capability does not exist, the surgeon is not accustomed to repair, the patient is not doing well physiologically, or there’s the need for the operating table – then you just have to ligate those. I think ligating those veins in the popliteal or femoral segment are also acceptable as a damage control maneuver.\nWe could not finish a peripheral vascular trauma talk without discussing fasciotomies. What are your advice for listeners regarding fasciotomies?\nIn the military setting, we have been liberal about the performance of two incision-four compartment-lower extremity fasciotomy. I think they should be done more liberally in our setting in the military. We advocate for them and have shown that they can be done without substantial additional morbidity and mortality. In fact, waiting to do a fasciotomy or missing a fasciotomy has been shown to be associated with mortality from early data from the wars. So part of that is in our system, we often are going to lose track of these patients. We will see them at a Role II, and then we would like to think, they don’t need the fasciotomy at the Role II because they will do it at the Role III. And then we are not going to do it the Role III, because they can do it in the Role IV. But again, we are going to be evacuating these patients at altitude and they are going to go out of our care. So I err on the side of prophylactic, two incision-four compartment fasciotomy in the setting of lower extremity vascular injury certainly with wartime vascular injuries.\n\n\n\n\nAbou Ali, Adham N., Karim M.

    "text": "20.1 Overview\nBrief overview of ultrasound: Ultrasonography uses sound waves with frequencies higher than those audible to humans. Ultrasound images are created by sending pulses of ultrasound into tissue using a probe. Reflected pulses are recorded and displayed as an image. There are many types of ultrasound images, but two modes commonly seen in vascular ultrasonography are B-mode and doppler:\nB-mode (Brightness) imaging is a 2-D, black and white display of tissue acoustic impedances.\nDoppler mode uses the Doppler effect to measure and visualize blood flow.\nSpectral Doppler converts frequency shifts from moving blood to velocities using the Doppler equation and displays a “spectrum” of these frequencies as Doppler waveforms.\nColor Doppler presents velocity information as a color-coded overlay on top of a B-mode image. Duplex ultrasonography is a term commonly used for the simultaneous presentation of B-mode and doppler data. Of note, when looking at a still image of a color flow duplex, the color may be misleading for direction because it may not be noted at which part of the cardiac cycle the picture was taken. It is far more reliable to look at the spectral doppler waveform.\nPower Doppler is less frequently used, but is based solely on amplitude of the doppler signal without giving information on direction. This is particularly useful to detect certain low or abnormal flow states, such as testicular/ovarian torsion, carotid string sign, slow intrarenal flow, supporting occlusion seen on B-mode or color.(Pellerito and Polak 2019)\n\n20.1.1 Waveforms\nWhat do normal spectral waveforms look like?\nNormal spectral waveforms have a brisk upstroke, sharp peak, rapid downstroke. A “spectral window” under the waveform, that is the black space between the spectral waveform and the 0 velocity axis, represents the absence of lower velocities - indicative of laminar flow within the vessel (Image 1: normal spectrum waveform)\n How can we differentiate low vs high resistance waveforms?\nWaveform profiles change depending upon the nature of the distal vascular bed being supplied. Organs like the brain, kidneys, liver, spleen, peripheral muscle during exercise, and postprandial SMA have constant high metabolic demand, and are therefore low resistance vascular beds. Low resistance waveforms for arteries supplying these organs demonstrate constant forward flow throughout the cardiac cycle because the distal bed being supplied has low resistance leading to high end-diastolic flow.\n In contrast, high resistance waveforms are seen for arteries supplying resting peripheral muscles, fasted mesenteric beds (such as the fasting SMA), and the external carotid artery. High resistance waveforms are characterized by triphasic morphology, with a sharp peak, early diastolic flow reversal, brief forward flow (elastic recoil of the artery, and then no flow during the remainder of the diastolic phase.\n How does flow-limiting stenosis change the waveform?\nFirst let’s define Stenosis: A hemodynamically significant stenosis (area reduction >50%) will result in a doubling of velocity from the inflow segment to the area of maximal stenosis (velocity ratio >2).\nNow what do waveforms look like AFTER a flow-limiting stenosis?\nTardus et parvus refers to a pattern of Doppler ultrasound spectral waveform resulting from arterial stenosis. The tardus et parvus waveform is delayed with prolonged systolic acceleration (tardus) and diminished with a small systolic amplitude and rounded systolic peak (parvus). This phenomenon is observed downstream from the site of stenosis. Tardus parvus in the CFA represents upstream (iliac) stenosis. Tardus parvus in the brachial artery likely represents upstream (subclavian or axillary) stenosis.(Hwang 2017; Pellerito and Polak 2019)\n So what will the waveform look like BEFORE a flow-limiting stenosis?\nDistal stenosis: Distal occlusive disease will result in a high resistance waveform, with absent diastolic flow. (Image 5: Distal stenosis with absent diastolic flow)\n Are there any considerations we need to understand when assessing a stented vessel with ultrasound?\nStenting decreases vessel compliance and increases observed velocities. There is no defined consensus, but in-stent restenosis is classified by some as follows:\n\n>50%\n\nSFA - Vr >1.5 or PSV >200 (Baril et al. 2009; Kawarada et al. 2013)\nICA - ICA/CCA >2.7 and PSV >220.(Lal et al. 2008)\n\n>80%\n\nSFA - Vr > 3.5 or PSV >275 (Baril et al. 2009; Kawarada et al. 2013)\nICA - ICA/CCA > 4.15 and PSV > 340.(Lal et al. 2008)\n\n\nIt should be noted that restenosis of stents vs vein grafts in the lower extremity will have higher velocity for the same percentage of stenosis. Tardus et parvus waveforms distal to a stent should raise concern that stenosis is hemodynamically significant.(Baril et al. 2009; Kawarada et al. 2013)\nUltrasound compared to other diagnostic modalities\nDuplex is often adequate to visualize any peripheral arterial bed, even the aorta and iliacs.(Muela Méndez et al. 2018)\n\nCT - limitations include ionizing radiation, iodinated contrast and is not appropriate in patients with CKD.\nMRA - is performed with gadolinium-based contrast and is not appropriate in patients with ESRD.\n\nNow that we’ve covered the basics, let’s move through by organ-system high-yield vascular lab studies, findings, and pathologies. We’ll start with the extracranial evaluation, a highly-tested area of vascular ultrasonography."

    "text": "20.2 Extracranial\nWhat does a typical extracranial evaluation involve?\nExamine CCA (2 views), ICA (2 views), ECA, vertebral arteries\nWhat are normal ICA and ECA waveforms?\nNormal ECA vs ICA waveform: The external carotid artery waveform reflects a high resistance vascular bed. This means minimal diastolic flow. Conversely, the ICA waveform reflects a low resistance vascular bed with antegrade diastolic flow.\n This makes sense, as the ICA is supplying the brain while the ECA is supplying the face. Intuitively, the common carotid artery is a mixture of the ICA and ECA waveform morphologies - like the ICA with forward flow throughout diastole, but less as compared to the ICA due to the high-resistance influence of the ECA.\nAnother way of differentiating the external and internal carotid arteries is the “temporal tap”. Tapping on the superficial temporal artery (a branch of the ECA) will be transmitted as small pulsations in the diastolic component of the external carotid artery.(Pellerito and Polak 2019; Size et al. 2013)\n\n\n\n\n\nCan you talk about diagnostic criteria for ICA stenosis?\nParameters for ICA stenosis: These are a few numbers that are (unfortunately) essential to memorize for the VSITE and RPVI.\nAlthough criteria differ between guidelines, the Carotid Consensus Criteria, define ICA stenosis >= 70% as a peak systolic velocity >= 230 cm/sec, EDV > 100 cm/sec, and ICA/CCA ratio > 4.0. Of note, post-stenting criteria vary from pre-stenting criteria. Stenosis criteria are not clearly defined for the CCA or ECA.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen is surgery indicated for ICA stenosis?\nParameters for when surgery indicated:\nAsymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study (ACAS) >60% stenosis asymptomatic, NASCET >50% stenosis symptomatic\nFor more see Chapter 1.\nLet’s talk about other pathologies that can be visualized on extracranial ultrasound:\nPathologies: Stenosis (plaque), dissection (flap), aneurysms (rare), occlusion (no flow, do not operate), carotid body tumor (splaying of ECA/ICA, fed by ECA branches), FMD.\nFMD is frequently encountered on the VSITE/RPVI. How would this appear on the exams?\nFibromuscular dysplasia of the internal carotid arteries affects women more commonly than men. Duplex findings show a “chain of lakes” appearance, demonstrative of multiple septa and small aneurysms. Velocity elevations and increased turbulence in the waveform patterns is typically found on Doppler interrogation.(Olin et al. 2012)\n\n\n\n\n\nAortic stenosis: Tardus parvus waveforms in both common carotid arteries can be a sign of more proximal disease of the aortic valve or global myocardial dysfunction.\nHow to treat?\nAspirin if asymptomatic, POBA if symptomatic.\nAre there other frequently tested pathologies demonstrated on extracranial exam?\nSubclavian steal: Subclavian steal occurs when a proximal subclavian stenosis or occlusion leads to reversal of vertebral artery flow. This causes “stealing” of blood from the posterior cerebral circulation, and presents as vertebrobasilar insufficiency.\nHow does this look on duplex?\nNormal vertebral flow looks very similar to ICA: antegrade low resistance waveforms with constant forward flow throughout the cardiac cycle. As subclavian stenosis progresses, one can see mid-systolic velocity deceleration (’bunny ears”), with mild stenosis bidirectional flow can signify “pre-steal” phenomena, and with severe steal, there is a complete reversal of flow in the vertebral artery towards the arm rather than towards the brain.(Kalaria et al. 2005; Mousa et al. 2017)\n\n\n\n\n\nInnominate stenosis: A phenomenon that is related to this, is innominate stenosis. Here again the patient will present with vertebrobasilar insufficiency, indicative of diminished vertebral antegrade flow, but additionally will experience right hemispheric insufficiency secondary to diminished R ICA antegrade flow. The right-side duplex will demonstrate flow reversal in the vertebral artery, abnormal waveforms in the subclavian, as well as steal pattern waveforms in the common and internal carotid arteries. The common denominator for all of these findings is significant disease in the innominate artery.\nWhat other extracranial arteries of the head and neck can be evaluated separately?\nTemporal arteritis - well visualized with high frequency transducer (10 MHz or greater). Pathognomonic halo effect of anechoic/hypoechoic edematous tissue surrounding the lumen due to concentric inflammation.(Ball et al. 2010; Schmidt 2014)"

    "text": "20.3 Intracranial\nSo that covers extracranial vascular lab evaluation. What about intracranial?\nThis is less frequently tested, so we will discuss just a brief overview of views and some of the more commonly tested pathologies related to transcranial doppler (TCD).\nIntracranial - Arteries differentiated by depth. MCA 3-6 cm, everything else deeper. Three primary views:\n\nTemporal view: Used to interrogate PCA, ACA, MCA, and ICA. The MCA, ICA and PCA flow direction is towards the probe, the ACA flow direction is away.\nOccipital (Foraminal) view: Basilar and vertebral arteries (both away).\nOrbital view: Ophthalmic and ICA\n\nWhat are some frequently tested pathologies that are identified on TCD?\nIndications often tested:\n\nMCA spasm (severe PSV>200): Can be seen in sickle cell disease with studies indicating a strong correlation between mean velocities of >200cm/s and the rate of stroke in children with sickle cell disease. With blood transfusions, stroke risk can be reduced from >10% to <1% per year. (Bulas et al. 2000)\n\nLindegrad ratio is the MCA velocity divided by the distal ICA velocity and can also be used to assess MCA spasm.\n\nRatio of 3-6 is indicative of mild-mod vasospasm.\n>6 is severe vasospasm.\n<3 is a sign of hyperemia.(Kirsch et al. 2013)\n\n\nCerebral ischemia during CEA: Comparing transcranial Doppler sonography, near-infrared spectroscopy, stump pressure measurement, and somatosensory evoked potentials, cerebral ischemia was most accurately predicted by the percent change in transcranial Doppler detected middle cerebral artery velocity. Detection of a greater than 50% drop in middle cerebral artery velocity using transcranial Doppler is 100% sensitive for detecting cerebral ischemia.(Moritz et al. 2007)\n\nTCD can also demonstrate microemboli (high spikes of white vertical lines on spectral doppler) during CEA.\n\nA shower of bubbles in both cerebral hemispheres upon injection with agitated saline is consistent with a R to L cardiac shunt and patent foramen ovale.(Zito et al. 2009)\nElevated contralateral ICA velocities can demonstrate compensatory flow and collateralization and can be a sign of persistent MCA occlusion.\nMechanical Compression of the vertebral arteries: TCD will show normal posterior circulation velocities at rest, disappearance of waveform on provocative maneuvers, and increase in velocity once back in a neutral position representing a reactive hyperemia.(Vilela et al. 2005)\nVasomotor activity can be evaluated as well with TCD. Hypercapnia or breath-holding should result in vasodilation and increased flow. Hypocapnia will result in decreased flow. No change in response to hyper or hypocapnia can show poor cerebral autoregulation.(Müller et al. 1995)\nReversal of flow in the ophthalmic artery can be a sign of ipsilateral ICA occlusion.(Guan et al. 2013)\nBrain death determination - In patients with cerebral arrest (brain death) TCD will demonstrate a low amplitude, high-resistance waveform with to and fro flow with zero net flow."

    "text": "20.4 Upper Extremity\nHaving covered head and neck vasculature, let’s move on to peripheral vasculature. This is a huge area both on the VSITE/RPVI and in practice. In this section we’ll cover first the upper, then the lower extremity vasculature.\nSo first, what are characteristics of waveforms in the peripheral vasculature?\nPeripheral: Normal waveforms are indicative of high resistance distal beds, so we would expect triphasic waveforms\nWhat are normal arterial parameters in the upper extremities?\nNormal pressure gradient between the right and left brachial pressures is <20 mmHg. Normal finger pressure is >80% of the ipsilateral brachial systolic pressure. Digital brachial index <0.8 is abnormal and <0.5 is diagnostic of ischemia. Absolute digital pressure <70mmHg is abnormal and <60mmHg is diagnostic for ischemia. A gradient between digits of >15 mmHg is considered abnormal. These criteria are used in occlusive disease and steal syndrome.(Chloros et al. 2008; Sen and Tripathi 2016)\nLet’s talk about some of the most frequently tested pathologies, starting with arterial TOS.\nArterial TOS: Results from compression of the subclavian artery at the level of the first rib within the scalene triangle. Arterial TOS testing is done by placing a sensor, most often photoplethysmography (PPG), on one finger of each hand, recording the resting waveforms and then recording while during maneuvers to evoke arterial compression in the thoracic outlet.(Size et al. 2013)\nCan you tell us a little more about PPG testing?\nPhotoplethysmography (PPG) uses an infrared light to illuminate superficial tissue. The reflection is received by a photosensor, and amplitude of the reflected light is proportional to the volume of red blood cells in the sample area. A normal digital arterial PPG has a brisk upstroke with a narrow systolic peak, and a dicrotic notch on the downslope during diastole.(Carter and Tate 2001)\n\n\n\n\n\nDigital PPGs change with progression of peripheral vascular disease. The first changes are a loss of amplitude and loss of the dicrotic notch. More advanced disease findings include a flattened systolic peak and a prolonged upstroke. Significant arterial TOS is suggested when there is a loss or persistent flattening of the digit waveforms during any of the positional changes that can compress the subclavian artery (either with the clavicle, first rib and scalene muscle). However, it should be noted that up to one-third of patients without arterial TOS may have some degree of subclavian artery compression with positional maneuvers.\nWhat are other diseases affecting the upper extremity?\nRaynaud’s: Vasospastic disorder characterized by temporary vasospasm. Diagnosis may be assisted by decrease in digital waveforms with immersion of the hand in cold water.\nThromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger’s Disease): Is a segmental non-atherosclerotic inflammatory disorder characterized by microthrombosis that primarily involves the small- and medium-sized arteries. Ultrasonography may demonstrate the classical “corkscrew” collateral development at the level of occlusion. TA has a male predominance and first-line treatment is smoking cessation.\n\n20.4.1 Hemodialysis Access\nBefore we segue to the lower extremities, this is a good time to discuss an entity frequently tested on the VSITE that constitutes for many vascular surgeons a notable portion of their practice: hemodialysis access, and specifically fistulas.\nFistulas: Ultrasound is one of the key modalities used in identifying suitable anatomy for fistula placement, suitability of a fistula for dialysis, and finally complications of fistulas.\nSo first, assessment for fistula placement:\nThe optimal configuration for an AVF is determined on the basis of vein mapping and noninvasive studies. Veins should measure >3 mm in diameter (>2.5 mm may be acceptable, as veins are likely to dilate under anesthesia), and there should be no venous outflow stenosis or arterial inflow stenosis.\nLoss of phasic variation in the upper extremity veins may indicate central stenosis and that extremity may not be appropriate for access creation.(Y. C. Kim et al. 2009; Lok et al. 2020) Duplex ultrasound arterial imaging can be performed at the same time as vein mapping and can provide important predictors of fistula maturation, such as arterial diameter and flow. The minimal arterial lumen diameter is 2 mm.\nHow can we tell if a fistula is ready to be used for hemodialysis access?\nRule of 6’s: At six weeks post-creation the diameter of the fistula should be at least 6 mm and the depth no more than 0.6 cm. The flow rate should be at least 600ml/min, and the length of the fistula should be 6 cm to allow for a successful two-needle dialysis.\nBrachial artery volume flow rate (VFR) is one of the best measurements to identify poor fistula maturation. >800 ml/min is ideal, but >600 is often sufficient.(Ko et al. 2015) To determine the volume flow (VF) the sample volume (SV) should be opened wall to wall in a segment of fistula that is straight with a constant diameter and include all velocities present within the fistula. Angle correction should be less than 60 degrees.(Gerrickens et al. 2018; Ko et al. 2015)\nWhat do normal fistula spectral waveforms look like?\nWaveform: The arterial waveform should demonstrate very low resistance throughout diastole. End diastolic velocity should be one half to two thirds of peak systolic velocity in a well-functioning fistula. As a side note, this is also what one would see in an iatrogenic arteriovenous fistula, as between the femoral artery and vein.(Teodorescu, Gustavson, and Schanzer 2012)\nLet’s discuss commonly encountered complications and pathologies identified in association with fistulas:\nPseudoaneurysms: Pseudoaneurysms commonly occur when a puncture fails to seal and the blood is contained by the surrounding soft tissue. As in other locations, pseudoaneurysms are defined on imaging by a communicating neck between the arterial vessel and pseudoaneurysmal sac with “to-and-fro” waveform at duplex.(Mahmoud et al. 2015) While small pseudoaneurysms can be managed without intervention or surgery, larger pseudoaneurysms, pseudoaneurysms associated with infection or overlying skin changes or bleeding may require excision and repair.(Dennis F. Bandyk 2013)\nSteal syndrome: Hemodialysis-related steal, also known as access-related hand ischemia, which may occur in over half of all patients undergoing access creation. Steal is characterized by retrograde diastolic flow distal to the donor artery. Of note, reversal of flow in and of itself is not sufficient to cause distal ischemia with an intact palmar arch. This is commonly seen after access creation and represents physiologic steal phenomenon, rather than symptomatic steal syndrome. Digital pressures <60 mm Hg are highly sensitive and specific for predicting steal. Patients who have no symptoms (Grade 1 access-related hand ischemia), may be closely monitored without any intervention.\nHow do we treat more severe steal?\nFlow rate measurements of the fistula can help determine the optimal treatment (banding, revision using distal inflow, distal revascularization with interval ligation, proximalization of arterial inflow or ligation of the fistula). For more on steal, see Section 5.3.3\nSo steal can occur in the context of high fistula output, can we talk a bit about low fistula flow, as from stenosis?\nCentral venous stenosis: Venous outflow stenosis is the most common reason for arteriovenous graft failure. A low flow rate results in recirculation during the dialysis session. Venous obstruction manifests as arm swelling, and with central venous stenosis may present with collateral development over the upper extremity and chest wall.\nStenosis of fistula: Arterial and mid-graft stenosis can also cause complications, but are less common than venous stenosis. Stenosis on imaging will be represented by narrowing of luminal diameter of 50% (which correlates to a 75% reduction in cross-sectional area) on b-mode ultrasound, PSV>400, Vr >2.5, high-resistance waveform proximal to the stenosis, and tardus parvus waveform distal to the stenosis.(Dennis F. Bandyk 2013)"

    "section": "20.5 Lower Extremity",
    "text": "20.5 Lower Extremity\nCan you please tell us about some of the diagnostic modalities that are used to examine perfusion in the lower extremities?\nABIs: Ankle-brachial index measurement requires calculating the ratio of the highest ankle systolic pressure (posterior tibial artery or dorsalis pedis) over the highest brachial systolic pressure. Regardless of whether you’re doing the R or L ABI, use the higher arm pressure for both ratios. Normal ABI >0.9, severe disease indicated by ABI<0.5, and CLI by ABI<0.3.\nThe ankle-brachial index in diabetic patients is frequently unreliable due to incompressibility of the tibial vessels at the level of the cuff secondary to calcification. Consequently, toe pressures are mandatory in all patients with diabetes mellitus. Normal TBI>0.7.\nOf note, monophasic waveforms in the brachial artery likely represent proximal occlusive disease in the upper extremity and therefore make the ABI non-diagnostic because the upper extremity blood pressure is not likely not representative of central blood pressure.(Chen, Prout, and Jain 2014)\nTcPO2: When there is significant tissue loss, preventing TBI measurement, another option is transcutaneous oximetry (TcPO2).(Mills et al. 2014) Transcutaneous oximetry is a non-invasive method of measuring the tissue partial pressure of oxygen through a heated sensor on the skin. A TcPO2 value of 40 mmHg is the critical value below which wound healing is impaired and ischemia develops.\nAre there other non-invasive ways of determining extremity perfusion?\nPVRs: Pulse volume recordings. Normal PVR waveforms have a rapid upstroke, sharp peak, prominent dicrotic notch and downslope. This typically uses 4 cuffs. High thigh cuff should be 30% greater than brachial pressure, hence a thigh-brachial index of 1.3 is normal. However, ABI/PVRs may not demonstrate significantly abnormal values/waveforms in individuals with single level disease.\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise Test: During exercise testing, patients are placed on a treadmill after baseline resting ABIs are measured. The patient is then asked to walk for 5 minutes or until physical discomfort requires test cessation. The point when the patient reports pain starts is the initial claudication distance and the point where the patient stops is defined as the absolute claudication distance. Diagnostic criteria for a positive test include a drop-in ankle pressure of greater than 20 mmHg from baseline, drop in ABI greater than 0.2 from baseline, or inability of ankle pressures to return to baseline after 3 minutes.(Strandness and Bell 1964)\nSo just to briefly summarize, what are parameters associated with poor wound healing?\nParameters associated with poor wound healing: Considering these various testing modalities, what are factors associated with poor likelihood of wound healing? An ankle pressure <50 mmHg, ABI < 0.40, TcPO2 <20 mmHg, or a toe pressure <20 mmHg are considered predictive of non-healing.\nWhat is the utility of duplex in diagnosing lower extremity occlusive disease?\nDuplex ultrasound is utilized to further delineate the anatomy, level and severity of occlusive disease. Increased PSV can identify the site of a hemodynamically significant stenosis. Diminished waveforms often suggest more proximal disease.\nOf note, diffuse narrowing of the SFA can result in tardus et parvus waveforms in the popliteal, without necessarily demonstrating any areas of high velocity.(Aburahma and Perler 2022; Pellerito and Polak 2019)\nWhile duplex ultrasound most easily visualizes infrainguinal arterial disease, it can also be used to evaluate for iliac artery stenosis. Patients with an iliac Vr>2.5 or monophasic/biphasic waveforms in the CFA, suggest that further imaging of the iliac system may be required.(Heinen et al. 2018)\nUltrasound is frequently used for graft surveillance. Can you talk about graft surveillance parameters?\nSuggested bypass vein graft surveillance with ABI, clinical exam and duplex should begin immediately after surgery and then continues at 3, 6, and 12 months and then every 6 to 12 months thereafter.(Conte et al. 2006; Zierler et al. 2018) A velocity ratio (Vr) is often utilized in graft surveillance and is defined as the peak systolic velocity (PSV) at the site of a stenosis divided by the PSV in a normal vessel segment proximal to the stenosis.\n\nThe highest risk for graft thrombosis, and highest cause for concern, is suggested by PSV >300 cm/s, Vr >3.5, a mid-graft flow velocity <45 cm/s or a drop in ABI >0.15. (Dennis F. Bandyk et al. 1988; Zierler et al. 2018)\nIncreased risk grafts have a PSV 180-300 cm/s and a Vr 2.0-3.5.\nSpectral pulse wave doppler is more sensitive than color doppler to identify low flow states or thrombosed grafts.(Hedrick, Hykes, and Starchman 2005)\nCriteria for prosthetic grafts is higher than vein bypass. (Zierler et al. 2018)\n\nIntervention for recurrent vein bypass graft stenosis early after angioplasty may be best treated with an open revision and patch plasty.(Jongsma et al. 2016)\nPresenting with new swelling, pain and fluid around a prosthetic graft on duplex ultrasound may be a sign of underlying graft infection. PET and WBC scans may be positive up to 4 months after implantation, so do not provide much utility in the early post-operative period.(Puges et al. 2019)\n\n20.5.1 Pathologies\nLet’s talk about pathologies frequently encountered in the lower extremities:\n\n20.5.1.1 Pseudoaneurysms (particularly femoral)\nGray-scale ultrasonography demonstrates a hypoechoic cystic structure adjacent to an arterial supply. Color Doppler typically demonstrates a “yin-yang sign” within the pseudoaneurysm sac. The hallmark ultrasound sign is identification of a neck between the sac and the feeding artery with a “to-and-fro” spectral Doppler waveform measured at the neck. This represents the flow in and out of the PSA during systole and diastole.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnastomotic pseudoaneurysms develop in around 3% of femoral anastomoses and can be associated with arterial wall weakness, endarterectomy, mismatch between artery/graft, dilation/deterioration of graft material, increased/uneven tension of the anastomosis, or underlying infection.(Pellerito and Polak 2019)\n\n\n20.5.1.2 Dissections\nCharacteristic ultrasound findings on color Doppler include a parallel blood-flow channel that separates the true and false lumen, with diminished blood flow distally.(Ge et al. 2015; Kobayashi et al. 2018) Traumatic intimal flaps after knee dislocation can have a normal ABI and be asymptomatic, but they should be followed as they can progress.(Gaitini et al. 2008) Of note, if the false lumen is filled by a thrombus, it may not distinguishable from an intramural hematoma or noncalcified plaque.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20.5.1.3 Buerger’s Disease\nAlso known as thromboangiitis obliterans, this is a rare disease, but with characteristic findings on ultrasound of serpiginous/corkscrew collaterals, occlusion of distal calf/pedal arteries, and normal proximal arteries.(K. Busch 2011; Fujii et al. 2011)\nFor more see Section 3.3.4\nThere are several disease pathologies that are frequently tested relating to the popliteal fossa. Can you talk briefly about these?\n\n\n20.5.1.4 Cystic Adventitial Disease\nThis is a rare (but often tested) pathology. Adventitial cystic disease is a non-atherosclerotic etiology of claudication, most often affecting the popliteal artery in the lower extremity and leading to stenosis or occlusion. Duplex imaging of the popliteal artery will demonstrate an anechoic or hypoechoic intraluminal region with a smooth contour and stenosis documented by velocity increase on spectral doppler. Angiography will often show a classic “scimitar” sign - a smooth well-defined crescent-shaped defect.(Shaw et al. 2007; Winn et al. 2015)\n For more on adventitial cystic disease, see Section 17.3.2 This is not to be confused with:\n\n\n20.5.1.5 Bakers Cyst\nA benign, cystic structure found in the popliteal fossa and arising from the joint capsule. Flexion of the knee may result in compression of the popliteal artery by the cyst. On b-mode ultrasound, a well-defined, anechoic cystic structure with a ‘neck’ extending into the joint space between the semimembranosus tendon and the medial head of the gastrocnemius will be identified.\n Popliteal entrapment syndrome: decrease in ABI or loss of distal pulses with passive dorsiflexion or active plantar flexion of the foot caused by compression of the popliteal artery by the gastrocnemius."

    "text": "20.6 Abdominal\nLowest frequency transducers (2-4MHz) are used for imaging abdominal vessels.\n\n20.6.1 Aorta\nAbdominal Aortic Aneurysms (AAA): Ultrasound screening of a AAA is non-invasive, accurate, and cost-effective.(Chaikof et al. 2018)\n\nSensitivity of 98% and specificity of 99% for AAA diagnosis.(Wilmink et al. 2002)\nAneurysm is measured in transverse view, anterior to posterior diameter, outer wall to outer wall.(IAC 2021) Size criteria for AAA repair is 5.5 cm men, 5.0-5.5 cm in women.\nCan be limited by bowel gas or obesity - so recommend fasting.\nFor more details, see Chapter 10\n\nCan ultrasound be used for graft surveillance s/p EVAR?\nSurveillance color duplex ultrasound is safe if CT imaging at 1 year exhibits no sac growth, graft migration, or endoleak (or stable type II endoleak). Contrast enhanced duplex, in particular, has a high sensitivity and specificity to detect endoleaks.(Abraha et al. 2017; Kapetanios et al. 2019; Chaer et al. 2009)\nType II endoleak classification is subdivided on surveillance duplex. Type IIa has a single inflow vessel and a “to-and-fro” appearance, whereas Type IIb has multiple vessels and maintains a monophasic flow. Type IIa endoleaks with velocities greater than 100cm/sec are not likely to spontaneously resolve and may be resistant to therapy.(Arko et al. 2003; Marrewijk et al. 2004)\nType II endoleaks with stable sac size can continue surveillance with color duplex.(Chaikof et al. 2018; Karthikesalingam et al. 2012; Chaer et al. 2009) Any findings concerning for growth, endoleak or flow in the sac should have confirmatory CTA performed.(Maleux et al. 2017)\nSurveillance duplex does not reliably detect graft migration given challenge of renal arteries visualization in a long axis view of the aorta.(K. J. Busch et al. 2009)\nVelocities within stents are elevated from baseline due to stent rigidity, but a limb velocity >300cm/s with a Vr >3.5 is associated with a high risk of limb occlusion from stenosis or kinking and should undergo further investigation or intervention.(Chaikof et al. 2018; Blom et al. 2012)\nWhat other pathologies can be identified on ultrasound evaluation of the abdomen?\nCIA aneurysms: SVS defines CIA aneurysms as any permanent, localized dilatation of the iliac artery >1.5 cm in diameter (diameter 1.5x the normal diameter)\nPara-anastomotic pseudoaneurysms: As previously discussed (reported in up to 0.5% to 10% of cases)\nPenetrating aortic ulcers: Describes an ulcerating atherosclerotic lesion that penetrates the intima and progresses into the media. Associated with atherosclerotic plaque on ultrasound\nDissections: (as already discussed) a dissection flap is usually identified and color flow demonstrates dual channels (true and false lumens). Turbulent flow patterns are frequently encountered.\n\n\n20.6.2 Mesenteric Vasculature\nSo far we have steered clear of the mesenteric vasculature. But this is an area frequently encountered on exams. Let’s start with mesenteric vessel stenosis.\nCeliac and SMA stenosis: May present as chronic mesenteric ischemia. PSV >275 cm/s in the SMA or >200 cm/s in the celiac artery indicates >=70% stenosis. Normal SMA Doppler waveforms in the fasting patient show high resistance waveform, PSV <275 cm/s and no spectral broadening. In the postprandial state, the waveform becomes low resistance, with a slightly increased PSV and little to no spectral broadening. Significant SMA stenosis may be differentiated by the presence of spectral broadening and elevated PSV (>275cm/s) and EDV (>55cm/s).(AbuRahma et al. 2012; Oderich and Ribeiro 2019) Distal to the stenosis, one would expect a tardus parvus waveform. EDV >45 in SMA or >55 in celiac are predictive of stenosis (would expect higher diastolic flow in celiac trunk given low resistance vascular bed of liver and spleen).\nReversal of flow in the hepatic artery and mildly elevated SMA velocities may indirectly signify severe stenosis or occlusion of the celiac artery.\nNote that aberrant anatomy with the hepatic artery arising from the SMA, will result in the proximal SMA demonstrating a low resistance waveform, even in the fasted state.(Pellerito and Polak 2019)\nMesenteric duplex is still valid even if the patient has not fasted. The images may be technically more difficult to acquire due to bowel gas, however if velocities can be obtained, you are likely to see elevated PSV and low resistance waveform in the SMA. The EDV will also be elevated and should be interpreted with caution.\nIMA Stenosis: PSV >200 cm/s or aortic ratio >2.5 has a high sensitivity for hemodynamically significant stenosis. However, this is rarely clinically significant and does not require treatment.\nWhat other mesenteric vessel pathologies may be identified on vascular ultrasound?\nDissections: Rare without concomitant aortic dissection, describe only in case reports.(Gouëffic et al. 2002; Oglesby and Sorrell 2006)\nAneurysms: Rare. Repair >2 cm celiac, hepatic, SMA aneurysms and >3 cm splenic and renal.\nMedian arcuate ligament syndrome: MALS can cause significantly elevated velocities at the origin of the celiac artery. Testing is for reversible mechanical compression, as opposed to a fixed lesion from atherosclerotic disease. During deep inspiration or in the upright position the MAL is elevated and celiac velocities should normalize if stenosis is secondary to MALS.(Tembey et al. 2015)\nHepatic artery thrombosis: Mesenteric duplex is often performed in liver transplant patients. Hepatic artery thrombosis most often occurs within the first 30 days after liver transplantation, with an incidence of 1.5-9% and a mortality rate of 75%.(García-Criado et al. 2009; Sanyal et al. 2012)\n\n\n20.6.3 Portal Vein\nSo I recognize that we are jumping ahead here discussing venous circulation, but as this represents another component of a mesenteric vascular exam, let’s discuss portal venous ultrasonography.\nNormal portal venous flow is hepatopetal (toward the liver), whereas abnormal portal venous flow is hepatofugal (away from the liver). (The root “fugua” means to flee, or flight). Flow should be in the same direction as the hepatic artery.\nOther abnormalities that may be visualized are portal vein thrombosis - often associated with portal venous hypertension in patients with chronic cirrhosis, hepatitis, or hepatocellular carcinoma. Acute portal vein thrombosis on ultrasound demonstrates dilatation of the portal vein with hypoechoic intraluminal thrombus. Chronic portal vein thrombosis is characterized by a contracted vein with heterogeneous/hyperechoic echoes and may be associated with collateral formation.(Chawla and Bodh 2015; Nouvini and Hapani 2013)\nMesenteric duplex can also assess for functioning of TIPS (transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt). A sign of a failing TIPS is portal vein peak systolic velocity less than 30cm/s.\n\n\n20.6.4 Renal arteries\nAwesome, and so before jumping fully into venous circulation, let’s complete our discussion of abdominal ultrasound evaluation with a discussion of the renal vasculature.\nRenal Pathologies: ostial (atherosclerotic) vs mid-artery (FMD)\nAtherosclerotic stenosis: PSV > 285 cm/s and Renal-aortic ratio (RAR) >3.5, suggest >60% stenosis.(Schäberle et al. 2016) However aortic PSV needs to be within normal range (40-100) to be appropriately interpreted.\nThe renal resistive index (RRI) is calculated as the RA (PSV-EDV)/PSV. The RRI (>0.8) is an indicator of intrinsic parenchymal renal disease. RRI has been used for assessment of transplant renal allograft rejection, decision making for treatment of renal artery stenosis and to evaluate progression of CKD. Diabetic nephropathy will demonstrate elevated RRI, signifying parenchymal disease.(Viazzi et al. 2014) One study showed it was associated with poor renal and overall outcome in critically ill patients.(Le Dorze et al. 2012)\nFMD: Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) will demonstrate tortuous renal arteries with turbulent flow and increased PSV of the mid-distal portions. Beading may be difficult to see on ultrasound (compared to the extracranial carotid). Atherosclerosis disease is primarily ostial in nature.\nIn-stent restenosis: Higher cut off values are required to determine in stent restenosis.(Chi et al. 2009; Schäberle et al. 2016)\nRenal artery aneurysms: Can see a yin-yang sign. (Gutta et al. 2008; Ham and Weaver 2014)"

    "text": "20.7 Venous\nVenous Exam: Uses a linear transducer. Complete deep venous reflux duplex examination includes color and pulsed wave spectral doppler imaging. Spontaneous Doppler waveforms as well as provocative maneuvers are recorded in the common femoral, femoral, popliteal, and tibial deep veins. Superficial veins (GSV, SSV, and perforator veins) are evaluated with provocative maneuvers to test valve competency. Diameters are also included for superficial veins. Transverse B-mode images are used for vessel compression (as when looking for thrombus) to ensure that the vein is fully compressible under probe pressure as opposed to simply slipping out of view, as may occur in longitudinal views. Reflux exam should be performed with a patient standing, with assessment performed on the non weight-bearing leg.\nWe’ve talked extensively about normal arterial waveforms; what do normal venous waveforms look like?\nNormal venous waveforms: Normal flow patterns of iliac and femoral veins demonstrate phasicity and should augment with distal compression. In the upper extremity central veins, doppler waveforms normally demonstrate pulsatility and phasicity.\nWhat does this mean? Pulsatility, phasicity, and augmentation?\nPulsatility: Refers to changes in the venous waveform in accordance with the cardiac cycle. Pulsatility is normal in the upper extremity veins central veins, given their proximity to the heart.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is an abnormal finding in the lower extremity veins, and may be a sign of pulmonary hypertension, right heart failure, or tricuspid regurgitation.(Kakish et al. 1996; McClure et al. 2000)\nPhasicity: (also called respiratory phasicity) is variation in the waveform with respiration. This results from increasing and decreasing intrathoracic pressures secondary to respiration. Phasicity is an indicator of a patency proximal to the point of measurement. So if we see lack of phasicity (continuous flow) in the left femoral vein but normal phasicity in the right, we would be concerned for left iliac vein occlusion or stenosis. If we saw absence of phasicity (continuous flow) in the bilateral femoral veins, we would be concerned for IVC obstruction or stenosis.\n Augmentation: Distal compression that augments forward flow. For example, if we are measuring flow at the femoral vein and we squeeze the calf and we see augmentation in the waveform, this indicates lack of occlusion in the venous system from the knee to the probe.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are venous pathologies that are commonly tested/encountered?\n\n20.7.1 Reflux\nVenous reflux due to valvular incompetence is best assessed with duplex scanning in the upright position. Reflux in the common femoral vein and the saphenofemoral junction may be elicited with a Valsalva maneuver (which increases intra-abdominal pressure), but release of a pneumatic cuff compression is a more reproducible method. Reflux is identified as reverse flow - that is, away from the heart - following valsalva or release of the compression cuff.\n Consensus guidelines suggest a cutoff value of 1 second for abnormally reversed flow (reflux) in the femoral and popliteal veins and of 0.5 seconds for the great saphenous vein, small saphenous vein, tibial, and deep femoral veins.(Gloviczki et al. 2011; Lurie et al. 2012; Labropoulos et al. 2003)\nPerforator veins: Perforator veins connect the deep and superficial venous systems, penetrating the deep fascia overlying the muscle. Size >3.5 mm and reflux >350 ms (deep to superficial) is associated with perforator reflux.(Min, Khilnani, and Golia 2003; O’Donnell et al. 2014; Sandri et al. 1999) Pathological perforators are found in association with a healed or non-healed ulcer.\nWhat are some other examples of reflux?\nOvarian vein reflux: The ultrasound evaluation of pelvic congestion syndrome is performed in a fasting patient in steep reverse Trendelenburg and standing positions with a low-frequency probe. Reflux is identified during the Valsalva maneuver. There are no validated criteria for the duration of reflux, rather, an ovarian vein diameter >6 mm is considered significant.\n\n\n20.7.2 May Thurner Syndrome\nMay Thurner syndrome is also known as iliac vein compression syndrome, refers to a chronic compression of the left common iliac vein by the overlying right common iliac artery (CIA), with or without deep venous thrombosis. Notably, patients present with unilateral (left) lower extremity edema and pain, varicosities, DVT or venous ulcers. Intravascular ultrasound will demonstrate >50% stenosis of the iliac vein from compression.\nIliac obstruction, whether a result so May Thurner or not, would demonstrate continuous flow with a loss of phasicity and reduced augmentation with distal compression or valsalva. Additional indirect ultrasound findings include collaterals and reversal of flow. Direct ultrasound findings include intraluminal changes.(Metzger et al. 2016)\n\n\n20.7.3 Nutcracker Syndrome\nNutcracker syndrome is most often diagnosed based on IVUS, venogram or renal vein pressures, but there are also diagnostic criteria for duplex ultrasonography. The left renal vein velocity ratio is the velocity at the aortomesenteric angle divided by the velocity near the left renal hilum. A ratio greater than 5 has a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 94% for Nutcracker syndrome.(S. H. Kim et al. 1996; Seung Hyup Kim 2019)\n\n\n20.7.4 Thrombosis\nThrombosis: Characteristics of acute thrombus are an echolucent and incompressible thrombus in a thin-walled vein with significant distension.\n Acute thrombus typically causes the vein to dilate with a diameter greater than the diameter of the adjacent artery. Venous wall thickening/scarring, a contracted vein, recanalization, and collaterals are found in chronic thrombosis.\nComponents of a lower extremity DVT study include doppler waveforms in response to provocative maneuvers in the common femoral, femoral and popliteal veins. When performing a DVT scan, the technician should evaluate the contralateral femoral vein flow to compare flow patterns.(Needleman et al. 2018; Vascular Ultrasound 2019) Transverse views are used for compression and compressibility testing every 3-5cm is the most reliable evaluation for thrombus.(Malgor and Labropoulos 2013)\nLet’s discuss some examples of venous thrombosis\nVenous TOS: Venous thoracic outlet syndrome is thrombosis or severe stenosis of the subclavian or axillary veins secondary to chronic extrinsic mechanical compression. Repetitive injury to the subclavian vein at the level of the costoclavicular space results in chronic injury to the veins. Venous duplex may show a dilated, non-compressible vein consistent with an acute subclavian vein DVT, or lack of pulsatility/phasicity if obstruction/stenosis is more centrally located. Duplex ultrasound is 81-100% sensitive for diagnosing upper extremity DVT.(Mustafa et al. 2002)\nEHIT or Endovenous Heat Induced Thrombosis: S/p endovenous thermal ablations (RFA or laser ablation) of the GSV. 4 Grades: Grade 1 is thrombus in the GSV up to the level of the CFV. If < 50% of the CFV lumen is involved this is EHIT grade 2. EHIT grade 3 is extension into the CFV occupying >50% of the lumen and grade 4 is occlusion of the CFV.\n EHIT grades 3-4 are typically treated with anticoagulation to reduce risk of PE. To minimize the risk of EHIT, the catheter should be positioned at least 2 cm from the saphenofemoral junction.\nSuperficial vein thrombosis: when scanning for superficial vein thrombosis, pornographers should scan superficial and deep veins of the ipsilateral leg and the contralateral central veins with doppler wave form, because the incidence of concomitant thrombosis is not insignificant.(Decousus et al. 2010; IAC 2021; Vascular Ultrasound 2019) This is discussed more in our venous chapter: Section 18.1.4.1\n\n\n20.7.5 Vein Mapping\nOne additional venous study often performed in the lower extremity is mapping of the GSV for planning lower extremity bypasses. Mapping should identify the general course of the GSV and any major tributaries, particularly if the anterior or posterior accessory veins are of a size that might be a reasonable additional conduit.(Cohn, Caggiati, and Korver 2006) Sonographers should also make note of any significant areas of tortuosity or aneurysm that might compromise the quality of the bypass conduit. Size measurements are usually made along the GSV.\nIn general the ideal size for conduit is 3-4mm throughout it’s length, with a size of greater than 2mm at the ankle.(Leopold et al. 1989) These size assessments are usually the same regardless of whether the vein will be fully harvested and reversed or utilized in situ. The small saphenous vein can be utilized for a conduit if the GSV is not adequate and the diameter is 3-4mm.(Chang et al. 1992; Nierlich et al. 2019)"

    "section": "20.8 Artifacts",
    "text": "20.8 Artifacts\nFinally, let’s wrap up this episode with a discussion of imaging artifacts. These are frequently encountered and tested in vascular ultrasound, and it is important to recognize imaging artifacts in order to prevent incorrect interpretation.\nAcoustic shadowing: Shadowing on an ultrasound image is characterized by a signal void behind structures that strongly absorb, reflect, or refract ultrasonic waves.\n Practically speaking, this most typically occurs deep to strongly reflective surfaces such as calcified plaques, and appears as a “dark area” beneath the plaque. Subcutaneous air can result in shadowing and loss of imaging information, which can be seen in some soft tissue necrotising infections.(Thom and Warlaumont 2017)\nAcoustic enhancement is essentially the inverse situation, and appears as a “bright area” deep to structures that transmit ultrasound waves exceptionally well. This can happen deep to fluid-filled structures such as cysts.\nMirroring: A mirror-image artifact is caused by reverberation of ultrasound and shows structures that exist on one side of a strong reflector as also being present on the other side of the reflector.\n This is often seen around the pleura and the diaphragm, due to the strong reflection of ultrasound from the air-filled lung. These artifacts can occur in both B-mode imaging where you see the mirrored image and Doppler, in which you see the mirrored waveform. The clavicle is also a strong spectral reflector, and thus can result in a mirror effect and a duplicate subclavian artery.(Rubin et al. 2010)\nRefraction: A refraction artifact is the result of ultrasound waves passing through tissues with different propagation velocities (such as air and water) and causes a structure to be improperly positioned laterally in the image. This is the phenomenon that results in a straw appearing bent when in a glass of water.\nSpeed artifact: Depth determination by an ultrasound machine is based on calculations using an average propagation velocity of sound in soft tissue of 1540 m/s. If the ultrasound wave passes through a medium at a different speed than predicted by the machine, an inaccurate image depth will be displayed. If the ultrasound passes less quickly through the material than soft tissue (as occurs in air or fluid), then the image will be displayed deeper than the true depth. In practical application, this is what causes a “bayonet” sign, or apparent bending of a needle when it passes from soft tissue into a cystic structure.\nInappropriate color gain: Overly gained images will show “speckling” in areas in which no flow is present (such as in soft tissue). Increasing the gain, increases both the signal and the noise.(Kremkau 2021) The noise added to the spectral waveform can result in PSV overestimation.\n Under-gaining will result in reduced sensitivity to low velocity flow.\nInappropriate angle correction: Make sure the angle correction cursor is centered in the vessel and parallel to the walls, otherwise the Doppler velocity measurement will be incorrect. Increasing the doppler angle will increase the velocity measurement (if no change to angle correction is made).\n Finally, can we talk about aliasing, as I feel like this comes up a lot on exams:\nAliasing: Unlike continuous wave Doppler, pulsed wave and color flow Doppler are characterized by rapid pulses of ultrasound waves (at a rate called the pulse repetition frequency). The Nyquist limit defines the frequency at which aliasing will occur, as equal to the PRF/2. So what does this mean practically? In pulsed wave doppler, if the velocity of blood is greater than ½ the PRF, the peak velocity will be cut off, and wrapped around to the bottom of the scale.\n This results in inaccurate measurement of peak velocities, and may be remedied by increasing the PRF and hence the scale. In color flow doppler, aliasing appears as red to blue hues without separation of a black region indicating no flow. This occurs in areas of high velocity (such as immediately post-stenosis). This can be remedied with an increase in the color scale. Of note, if asked to determine the direction of blood flow in a vessel demonstrating aliasing, one should assess the flow in low-velocity areas of blood flow, as seen along vessel walls."

Because most endovascular procedures are performed percutaneously using arterial or venous access, it is critical that vascular surgeons are facile with various techniques and devices used for endovascular access. Today we’ll be discussing the various access sites, techniques for access, closure devices, and complications.\nWhat factors play a role when choosing a site for access?\nThe factors to think about when thinking about which vessel to access are:\n\nThe appropriateness of the access site the procedure performed\nAbility to obtain hemostasis at the conclusion of the procedure\nAbility to convert to open if necessary\nEffects of access on the tissues supplied by the accessed vessel and distal limb perfusion\n\nWhat makes a vessel appropriate for access?\nOne of the most important factors when planning your access is the size of the vessel. The vessel needs to be able to accommodate the catheters and devices that will be used to perform the procedure. For instance, a brachial artery with less than 4mm diameter should not be accessed by a large bore sheaths, such as a 12Fr sheath.\nThe vessel also needs to be a in a location that can allow access to the target vessel of interest. Additionally, the vessel needs to have an area that is relatively healthy to access the vessel safely and minimize complications. Heavily calcified vessels especially those with anterior wall calcification might not be appropriate for access.\nWhat about the ability obtaining hemostasis at the end of the procedure?\nThe ability to obtain hemostasis is critical to be able to perform endovascular procedures safely which is one reason why the common femoral artery is the most commonly accessed vessel.\nHemostasis is most commonly achieved through manual compression by compressing the artery against the femoral head. The brachial artery can also be compressed against the humerus, but because it’s a more mobile vessel, compression is less effective and can lead to hematoma or pseudoaneurysm formation which may necessitate an operation to prevent compression of the median nerve\nPatients who will need to be uninterruptedly anticoagulated peri- and post-operatively pose a challenge to hemostasis. The use of closure devices is very important in these situations to prevent access bleeding.\nA variety of closure devices can also be used to assist in hemostasis, each with their own inherent advantages and disadvantages. In general, closure devices are contraindicated in small diameter and heavily calcified vessels.\nIn any minimally invasive procedure, there is always a chance that you may need to convert to open. How does converting to open play a role in vascular access?\nConversion to open is uncommon with vessel access accounting for <5% of the cases. Sometimes a large sheath is accidentally pulled out and a cutdown becomes necessary to repair the artery. Closure devices aren’t 100% effective in hemostasis and may also require a cutdown for definitive control if they fail, especially when obtaining large bore access.\nThis makes choosing the right vessel critical. For example, if a large sheath is accidentally pulled out of the CFA during an EVAR, the repair can be done through a straightforward groin cutdown. In contrast, the subclavian artery is rarely accessed percutaneously because converting to open would require a more challenging peri-clavicular incision or even a thoracotomy for repair.\nLarge diameter sheaths are often used, particularly in aortic procedures. These sheaths can be occlusive which can result in downstream tissue ischemia. What considerations should be taken when thinking about downstream tissue ischemia?\nWhen performing diagnostic procedures using small diameter sheaths and catheters, anticoagulation may or may not be necessary depending on how diseased the access vessel is.\nHowever, when using large devices (e.g. in EVARs), the sheaths can be partially or completely occlusive which mandates full anticoagulation to prevent thrombosis. The other thing to consider is the length of time that the sheath remains in the vessel as the leg can only tolerate ischemia for 4-6 hours. This is usually pertinent when performing complex endovascular aortic procedures.\nTo minimize downstream tissue ischemia, a large bore sheath should be pulled back to decrease the length of vessel obstruction by its shaft in order to unblock proximal vessel collateral branch vessels. For instance, when performing an aortic procedure through a femoral access attempt to pull the sheath back into the external iliac artery to increase distal limb perfusion through the internal to femoral artery collateral branch vessels.\nThe long story short is to be liberal with anticoagulation when there is reduced flow in the vessel such as the iliofemoral system during EVAR or tibial access\nDo the principles that we’ve described also apply to veins?\nThe same principles apply but there are some notable differences between arterial and venous access.\nVeins are a low-pressure system, so hemostasis is easier to achieve and hemorrhagic complications are much less common. However, this poses a challenge during access as there is less radial force keeping the vein open making the vein more susceptible to compression by the ultrasound probe and the needle.\nIf a large bore sheath is necessary to perform a venous procedure, a suture-mediated closure device can be utilized to achieve hemostasis especially in patients that will be kept fully anticoagulated\nAdditionally, a syringe may be needed to confirm access and can also prevent air embolism\nLet’s talk about accessing the common femoral artery. Why is the CFA the most common vessel used for access?\nIt is large caliber and can accommodate large sheaths up to 26-28 Fr. It also allows for a wide set of procedures and is ergonomically easy to work with given its location. It is relatively easy to hold manual pressure and if a conversion to open is needed, a femoral cutdown is relatively straightforward.\nWhere in the common femoral artery is the best spot to access?\nThe ideal puncture site is in the CFA in the medial third of the femoral head in between the inguinal ligament and the femoral bifurcation in the middle of the femoral head.\nAccessing the vessel above the inguinal ligament makes compressing the artery very difficult which can lead to life-threatening retroperitoneal bleed.\nA puncture that is too distal and into the SFA increase the risk of thrombosis or dissection causing acute limb ischemia as well as AV fistula formation between the superficial femoral and profunda femoris artery.\nWhat are the different ways to obtain CFA access?\nThere are three different ways to access the CFA: manual palpation, fluoroscopic guided, and ultrasound guided.\nWith manual palpation, a finger is placed above and below the desired access point directly on the pulse and the needle is inserted in between the two fingers.\nFluoroscopic guidance uses bony landmarks relative to the position of the needle.\nThe standard of care in the modern era for obtaining CFA access is to use ultrasound guidance. Ultrasound allows visualization of the vessel and surrounding structures. PAD within the vessel can readily be identified with ultrasound, allowing safe access in a relatively disease-free part of the artery. Ultrasound also clearly shows the femoral bifurcation. Using ultrasound allows for subtle corrections in the angle of the needle and how it interacts with the surrounding tissues. It is rapid, real-time, inexpensive, and safe.\nWhat anatomic considerations should be taken when accessing the CFA?\nThe CFA is the continuation of the external iliac artery as it courses under the inguinal ligament. It is about 5-8 cm in length and then bifurcates in to the superficial femoral and profunda femoris arteries\nThe inguinal ligament is a good external landmark to estimate where the CFA is. It is critical to emphasize that the inguinal ligament does not correspond to the groin crease and this is especially true in obese patients. An imaginary line is drawn from the ASIS to the pubic tubercle. The artery generally runs a third of the way from the pubic tubercle to the ASIS. A metallic instrument can be placed in this area to mark it externally and a fluoroscopic image can be obtained to identify the relation of the instrument to the medial third of the femoral head. This imaginary line also marks the superior-most extent of the access\nThe CFA is most often accessed in a retrograde fashion in between the inguinal ligament and femoral bifurcation. This allows for a multitude of potential diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in most parts of the body.\nCan the CFA be accessed antegrade?\nYes. Sometimes antegrade CFA access is used when performing an intervention distal on the ipsilateral leg. The advantage of antegrade access is better pushability and torquability of wires, catheters, and sheaths when performing complex peripheral intervention where no other proximal procedures are needed.\nAntegrade access is more challenging than retrograde access, however. This is particularly true in patients with a very short CFA, short distance between the inguinal ligament and the femoral bifurcation because the needle requires a steeper angle of entry to allow for cannulation well above the femoral bifurcation.\nObtaining antegrade access is especially difficult in obese patients and will usually require an assistant to retract the pannus to allow proper needle placement. I would say antegrade access is relatively contraindicated in morbidly obese patients with large pannus. Ultrasound guidance remains key here as well.\nWhat are some other commonly accessed arteries for endovascular procedures?\nThe tibial vessels can be accessed percutaneously for retrograde recanalization for severe LE PAD. It is usually performed using micropuncture kits which we will discuss a little later. It is usually done with ultrasound guidance and uses small sheaths and wires. The PT and AT are more commonly used because they are easier to access.\nThe radial artery is commonly used in coronary interventions and is increasingly being used by vascular surgeons. It is easily palpable over the distal radius and can be cannulated with ease. Hemostasis is straightforward using compression. In the rare setting of radial occlusion, the hand rarely becomes ischemic because most people are ulnar dominant. It can accommodate sheaths up to 6 French.\n\nThe best way to reduce vasospasm and injury to the radial artery is utilizing a radial artery cocktail - calcium channel blocker, vasodilator, and anticoagulation.(Mason et al. 2018; Cauley et al. 2019)\n\nThe brachial artery can be accessed percutaneously over the olecranon process with the arm supinated.(Alvarez-Tostado et al. 2009) Ultrasound guidance allows for visualization of the brachial bifurcation. It can accommodate 6-7 Fr sheaths. Hemostasis is critically important as bleeding can result in a hematoma that results in median nerve compression, which is a surgical emergency. Cut down after brachial access has been shown to reduce complications.(Kret et al. 2016)\nLet’s not forget about venous access. What are some of the most commonly accessed veins?\nThe CFV is commonly accessed for procedures involving the IVC and iliac vessels and their branches for conditions such as May-Thurner, pelvic congestion syndrome, and IVC filter placement. Treatment of PE can also be performed through the CFV. The CFV can easily be compressed over the femoral head and is located medial to the CFA. Ultrasound guidance should be used to prevent arterial injury and backwalling.\nThe internal jugular vein can be accessed using US guidance (to prevent carotid injury; IJ is lateral to the carotid). IJ access is used most commonly for central venous catheters as well as IVC placement and filter retrieval. It is also an excellent access to treat pulmonary embolism via thrombolysis or thrombectomy. The IJ can be utilized to perform ovarian and internal iliac vein embolization. IJ is also the preferred access to perform TIPS, which is often of less interest to vascular surgeon.\nThe popliteal vein can be accessed with the patient in the prone position or the distal femoral vein in the supine position to diagnose and treat DVTs of the extremity veins. Ultrasound is also helpful to avoid arterial access and especially if the vein is thrombosed\nArm veins (cephalic/basilic) can be also readily accessed for vein mapping or fistula interventions.\nLet’s move on to access technique. Historically, there are two types of puncture needles: single-wall and double-wall. Can you talk about the differences?\nDouble wall needles were commonly used back in the day for femoral access. They have an outer hollow blunt-tipped needle and an inner sharp stylet. The needle was inserted through and through the artery and the stylet removed and the blunt hollow needle pulled back until blood is returned. These aren’t favored anymore because they cause unnecessary backwalling of the artery. Double wall access kits are used in treating endoleaks from both a transcaval and translumbar routes to allow access into the aneurysm sack and needle removal to avoid puncturing the endograft.\nSingle wall needles are typically the choice for diagnostic procedures. 18-gauge needles accommodate an 0.035 in wire and 21 gauge accommodates a 0.018 in wire.\nCan you describe the micropuncture technique for percutaneous access?\nMicropuncture technique is the most commonly used method for percutaneous access nowadays. The advantage of the micropuncture technique is the use of a small needle which can be removed and repositioned with a negligible risk of bleeding and minimal amount of manual compression needed.\nUltrasound is used to cannulate the artery with a 21-gauge needle. It is best to visualize the needle entering the artery and to be intraluminal without being against the wall Blood return is then seen and a floppy tip micropuncture (0.018) wire is inserted under fluoroscopic guidance to make sure the wire passes into the vessel easily. A 4 Fr introducer sheath is placed over the wire gently to avoid kinking the wire. The inner cannula of the sheath is removed, and a 0.035 guidewire is placed under fluoroscopic guidance. It is important to remember that there are two types of introducer sheath depending on amount of subcutaneous scar tissue containing either a soft or a stiffened cannula. The 4 Fr is removed over the wire while holding manual pressure and desired sheath (usually 5 or 6 Fr) is placed for definitive access. The side port is then aspirated for arterial blood and flushed with heparinized saline.\n\n\nWith any invasive procedure, there are risks of complications. What are some of the complications of percutaneous vascular access?\nHematomas are the most common complication and have an incidence of about 3%. Most of these hematomas are clinically insignificant but retroperitoneal hemorrhage from a high puncture above the inguinal ligament can be life-threatening. These may require conversion to open and direct repair of the vessel or covered stent placement (especially if the puncture is above the inguinal ligament). Proximal balloon occlusion can be helpful to control hemorrhage while the vessel is being repaired.\nGroin hematomas are not uncommon and are usually self-limiting. An expanding hematoma that is seen early can be treated with simple manual pressure at the bedside. If the hematoma is large and compressing surrounding structures or threatening skin integrity or if the patient is hemodynamically unstable, then surgical evacuation may be necessary\nPseudoaneurysms are an uncommon complication with an incidence of about 0.6%. Most pseudoaneurysms are treated with ultrasound-guided compression or thrombin injection. Thrombin injection requires a narrow neck into the pseudoaneurysm. If the pseudoaneurysm is >2cm, compresses surrounding structures, threatens skin integrity, or has failed thrombin injection, then surgical repair is required.(Morgan and Belli 2003; Stone, Campbell, and AbuRahma 2014) For a representative image, see Section 20.5.1.1\nThrombosis of the CFA is a known complication but fortunately is rare with an incidence of 0.2%. This can result from manual compression of the CFA that has severe atherosclerotic disease or prior groin reconstruction. This generally requires a cutdown, endarterectomy, thrombectomy, and patch angioplasty.\nLastly, AV fistula can form and are usually between the femoral artery and vein with an incidence of 0.5-0.9%). These usually occur from a low puncture of the CFA bifurcation or profunda. They are usually asymptomatic and detected on exam (palpable thrill) and confirmed with duplex imaging. If the fistula is small, it generally can be observed with close duplex surveillance. If it enlarges or becomes symptomatic, then repair is indicated. Covered stent grafts can be placed with minimal morbidity, making this optimal for high risk patients. Open surgery also is highly successful. Deciding between non-operative, endovascular, or open treatment is up for debate and is up to the clinical judgement of the surgeon."

    "text": "21.2 Radiation Safety\nAuthors: Adam P Johnson\n\n21.2.1 Important Terms\nAbsorbed Dose - energy deposited by ionizing radiation in a medium per unit mass. Dosage measured and communicated most commonly in Gray (Gy) equal to 100 rad.(Reed 2019)\nEffective Dose - energy deposited by ionizing radiation in a medium, taking into account the sensitivity of the specific tissue, time and duration of exposure. These factors compose a weighting factor (W) and thus this is calculated by multiplying absorbed dose (Gy) by the weighting factor (W). Dosage measured and communicated most commonly in Sievert (Sv) equal to 100 rem.(Reed 2019)\nReference Air Karma (RAK) - Radiation output at a specific reference point along a fluoroscopic axis.(Kirkwood et al. 2013)\n\nLocated 15cm along the beam axis toward the focal spot from the isocenter.\nBest approximation of cumulative patient dose or peak skin dose (PSD).(Kwon, Little, and Miller 2011)\nIncludes dose from fluoroscopy and fluorography acquisitions, however does not account for gantry angulation of changes in height.\n\nSubstantial Radiation Dose Level (SRDL) - defined as 5Gy exposure, which translates to a skin dose of 3Gy and should trigger specific patient follow up.(Baiter et al. 2011; Hirshfeld et al. 2005; Kirkwood et al. 2015; Stecker et al. 2009)\n\n\n21.2.2 Radiation effects\nThe effects can impact both patients and clinicians. Patients often receive a higher dose during a single procedure, where as clinician doses, even with proper shielding, accumulate over multiple procedures throughout their careers. The effects of radiation are defined as either deterministic or stochastic.\n\nSkin related deterministic effects that can be seen after a single exposure over a certain threshold (Balter et al. 2010; Hirshfeld et al. 2005; Kirkwood et al. 2014; Stecker et al. 2009; Wagner et al. 1999)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDose\nEffect\n\n\n\n\n0-2Gy\nNo observable effects\n\n\n2-5Gy\nTransient skin erythema and dermatitis, full recovery 6w-1yr(Guesnier-Dopagne et al. 2019; Kirkwood et al. 2014)\n\n\n5-10Gy\nErythema and epilation (hair loss), prolonged erythema up to 1y\n\n\n10-15Gy\nPermanent epilation, atrophy or induration up to 1y\n\n\n>15Gy\nDermal Necrosis\n\n\n\nThe ocular lens is the most radio-sensitive tissue and cataracts is an unfortunately common deterministic effect.(Machan 2018; Brown and Rzucidlo 2011) Annual limits for ocular exposure include 20mSv per year and total threshold of 0.5Gy.\nStochastic effects can occur after exposure of any dose, but are seen more frequently in populations with higher radiation exposure. These are based on population studies and exact dose dependent relationships have not been established. These include:\n\nBrain cancer(Rajaraman et al. 2016; Kirkwood et al. 2018)\nBreast and thyroid cancer(Johnson et al. 2001; Einstein 2012)\n\n\n\n21.2.3 Risk factors\nCertain patient, procedure and clinician factors put patients at increased risk for radiation exposure.(Killewich et al. 2011; Mitchell and Furey 2011) These should be considered when planing and executing endovascular procedures to ensure that dosages are as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA)\n\nPatient Factors\n\nObesity\n\nProcedure Factors\n\nCase complexity\nNeed for magnification\nCase orientation and angulation\n\nClinician Factors\n\nUse of multiple subtraction runs\n\n\n\n\n21.2.4 Reduction strategies\nThe main source of radiation to the clinicians is scatter from the patient. There are a number of techniques that can be used to reduce exposure of clinicians to this radiation.(Heidbuchel et al. 2014; Kirkwood et al. 2013)\n\nPreoperative planning is paramount to efficient use of radiation during a procedure. Recent ESVS guidelines recommend utilization of a 3D pre-operative planning software and image fusion (when available) for complex endovascular procedures.(Modarai et al. 2022)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake a Look\n\n\n\nCheck out Dr. Ellozy’s operative planning video where he reviews how to plan for an EVAR procedure utilizing Tera-Recon 3D imaging software.\n\n\n\nReduce the time of exposure, keeping a close eye on fluoroscopy time and dosages as a procedure progresses.\nPosition the source as far away from the operator as possible to still achieve optimal imaging. Radiation dose changes according to the inverse square of distance. Therefore twice the distance results in one quarter the dose.\n\nFor example, left anterior oblique (LAO) will bring the source to the patient’s right side, causing higher doses to clinicians on that side of the patient.(Kirkwood et al. 2013; Sailer et al. 2019)\n\nAppropriate shielding\n\nThe location with the highest exposure to scatter is below the table.(Gonzales, Moran, and Silberzweig 2014; Miller et al. 2010) Therefore, leaded skirt and extended lower body shields reduce radiation to the operator’s legs.(Kirkwood et al. 2015)\nOf note: leaded caps DO NOT reduce radiation exposure to the brain because the majority of radiation is received as scatter from the patient up through the face and neck.(Kirkwood et al. 2018)\nLead shielding should be regularly inspected and discarded if damaged. Particularly if defect is >15mm2 on a critical organ area, >670mm2 along a seem/overlapping area, >11mm2 on a thyroid shield.(Healthcare Inspections 2014; University, Stanford, and Complaints, n.d.)\n\nCollimation can be helpful to reduce patient and operator dose, scatter and improve image quality.(Haqqani et al. 2012)\nUse last image hold to allow for procedural planning\n\n\n\n21.2.5 Pregnancy considerations\nPregnancy of both patients and clinicians need to be considered in relation to radiation exposure and safety.(Chandra et al. 2013; Mitchell and Furey 2011; Shaw et al. 2011) This is a highly tested subject on vascular surgery examinations. Some important take aways include:\n\nCDC has released guidance for potential prenatal effects on radiation exposure(CDC 2011) The majority of effects on fetuses is extrapolated from studies of the fall out from Hiroshima, Nagasaki and Chernobyl.\n\n<0.05Gy represents no measurable risk to embryo or fetus at any gestational age.\n0.05-0.5Gy can be dangerous in the first trimester, but has not been associated with defects later in pregnancy.(Shaw et al. 2011)\n>0.5Gy can be dangerous at any point during pregnancy.\n\nDose limit recommendations during the 9 months of pregnancy is 500mrem or 50mrem per month.(Dauer et al. 2015; Chandra et al. 2013)\n\nStrategies to reduce exposure include:\n\nAvoid direct fluoroscopy to the fetus, high-gantry angulation, and femoral access\n\nUse collimation to ensure fetus is excluded from imaging field.\n\nUse adjuncts of intravascular ultrasound and lead shielding when able.\nReduce machine kilo-voltage and milliampere/second.\nRemove the anti-scatter grid to reduce dosage to patient.(Tomà et al. 2019)\nLimit fluoro time.\nSome recommendations state that operators who intend to get pregnant should start wearing maternity aprons (lead equivalent to 1mm) even prior to knowing they are pregnant.(Shaw et al. 2011)\n\nOriginal studies demonstrated reduction in fetal exposure by 80%.(Witrak and Sprawls 1984)\nHowever, a recent multi-institutional review showed that fetal exposure is minimal even in regular lead, therefore the additional weight of maternal lead may be unnecessary.(Chandra et al. 2013)\n\n\n\n\n21.2.6 Regulation\nJoint Commission Oversight - sentinel radiation reporting is aimed to promote awareness of preventable events perform root cause analyses to understand the reasons for events.(Commission 2019) It is important to escalate events early, as effects may not occur until much later.(Arbique, n.d.) Sentinel events include:\n\nCumulative dose of 15 Gy for a single field over 6mo - 1yr.\nDelivery of radiotherapy to the wrong body region.\nActual dose more than 25% above planned radiotherapy dose.(Jones and Pasciak 2011)\n\nInstitutional Oversight - many institutions develop their own guidelines for employee exposure and mitigation strategies. Some common policies regarding dose limits include:\n\nMonthly limit for dosimeter reading of 100mrem per month.\nRecommendations for annual occupational dose is <20mSv per year averaged over 5y and no more than 50mSv in any one year. Occupational dose <100mSv per year is not thought to increase cancer risk\n\nRecent reduction of occupational dose limit to 50mSv is due to increasing data connecting cataracts to radiation exposure.(Hamada et al. 2017)"

    "section": "21.3 Contrast Reduction",
    "text": "21.3 Contrast Reduction\nThe most common complications related to iodinated contrast during endovascular procedures are hypersensitivities and acute kidney injury. There are a number of mitigation strategies to limit the effect of contrast on patients undergoing endovascular procedures.\nIn general patients with food allergies do have an increased incidence of contrast media allergies, however no specific common allergen has been identified. A new seafood allergy should not postpone or require pre-medication if a patient has previously tolerated IV contrast.(Schabelman and Witting 2010)\n\n21.3.1 CO2 Angiography\nCO2 angiography is often utilized in place of iodinated contrast during fluoroscopy. A bolus of CO2 is injected, which then absorbs less ionizing radiation than surrounding tissue and provides a map of the arterial tree. CO2 can be used in a wide range of endovascular procedures, even a ruptured AAA.(Knipp et al. 2010) However, there are specific limitations and complications that should be understood.\n\n21.3.1.1 Limitations\n\nContraindicated in imaging above the diaphragm.(Caridi and Hawkins 1997; Sharafuddin and Marjan 2017)\nSusceptible to bolus fragmentation and often requires stacking to fully visualize the target arterial bed.(Caridi and Hawkins 1997; Sharafuddin and Marjan 2017)\nBowel gas can limit imaging of the abdomen. Glucagon can be administered to reduce bowel gas motion artifact and improve the image.(Caridi and Hawkins 1997; Kyung Jae Cho 2015; Criado et al. 2012; Sharafuddin and Marjan 2017)\n\n\n\n21.3.1.2 Complications\n\nVapor lock - can occur with high volume, serial injections where contaminated air accumulates. Strategies to reduce incidence include waiting 1-3min between angiography runs. Operators should use a one way valve to reduce risk of air contamination.(Kyung J. Cho and Hawkins 2011; Kyung Jae Cho 2015)\n\nCardiac/pulmonary vapor lock can occur with venography. Mimics a PE with hypoxia and hypotension. Initial management is to place patient in the left lateral decubitus/trendelenberg position.(Caridi and Hawkins 1997; Sharafuddin and Marjan 2017)\nMesenteric vapor lock presents with significant unrelenting abdominal pain. Fluoroscopy can confirm a retained bubble. Initial management includes ongoing heparinization to prevent down stream thrombosis and maneuvers to break up the bubble by rotating the patient side-to-side or deep abdominal massage. Catheter aspiration may be needed.(Caridi and Hawkins 1997; Sharafuddin and Marjan 2017)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlvarez-Tostado, Javier A., Mireille A. Moise, James F. Bena, Mircea L. Pavkov, Roy K.
