<p><strong>What is an aortic dissection?</strong></p>
<p>It’s when a tear occurs in the intima that results in separation of layers of the intima and media and allows blood to flow through the false lumen.</p>
<p><strong>How common are they and how serious are they?</strong></p>
<p>Acute dissections occur around 3/100000 - 2-3x more common than ruptured aortic aneurysm. For Type A dissections, early mortality 1-2% per hour - if untreated, 20% die within 6 hours, 50% within 24 hours, 70% first week.</p>
<p>Main cause of death in type A is aortic rupture into the pericardium, acute aortic regurgitation, and coronary ostia compromise. While patients with descending thoracic aortic dissections are more likely to die from end organ compromise due to obstruction of visceral or extremity vessels in the acute phase of the disease.</p>
<p><strong>The time frame is also important.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Hyperacute &lt;24 hours</p></li>
<li><p>Acute &lt; 2 weeks</p></li>
<li><p>Subacute 2 weeks – 3 months -&gt; TEVAR</p></li>
<li><p>Chronic &gt;3 months -&gt; Chronic aneurysmal degeneration/ partial false lumen thrombosis (highest risk) = operative treatment</p></li>

<h4 data-number="4.1.1.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="classification-and-terminology"><span class="header-section-number">4.1.1.1</span> Classification and Terminology</h4>
<p><strong>When we think about aortic dissections there are a few classifications, how can we break it down?</strong></p>
<p>Historically, there are the Stanford and Debakey Criteria.</p>
<p>Anatomical Stanford</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Type A - involves the ascending aorta, 2/3 (most common)</p></li>
<li><p>Type B - arises from distal to L subclavian, 1/3</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Debakey</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A</p>
<ul>
<li><p>1 - ascending + descending</p></li>
<li><p>2 - ascending only</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>B - distal or at the LSCA.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>3a - Descending aorta above diaphragm</p></li>
<li><p>3b - Descending aorta above and below diaphragm</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How about the new system proposed by Dr Lombardi, the SVS-STS classification system?</strong></p>
<p>The new system published in 2020 keeps A and B and adds a number system which divides the aorta into zones from 0 proximaly to 12 distally in the mid SFA. <span class="citation" data-cites="lombardiSocietyVascularSurgery2020">(<a href="references.html#ref-lombardiSocietyVascularSurgery2020" role="doc-biblioref">Lombardi, Hughes, et al. 2020</a>)</span></p>

<p><img src="images/thoracic_dissection1.png" class="img-fluid" width="470"></p>
</div>
</div>
<ul>
<li><p>Type A is now JUST the ascending aorta to the innominate, also called Zone 0.</p></li>
<li><p>Type B is now an entry tear in Zone 1 or greater and distally to whichever zone the dissection lands in.</p></li>
</ul>
<section id="penetrating-aortic-ulcer-and-intramural-hematoma" class="level5" data-number="4.1.1.1.1">
<h5 data-number="4.1.1.1.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="penetrating-aortic-ulcer-and-intramural-hematoma"><span class="header-section-number">4.1.1.1.1</span> Penetrating Aortic Ulcer and Intramural Hematoma</h5>
<p><strong>This anatomical classification is based on reading the CT angio. What else could we see on a CT angio that we have to know about?</strong></p>
<p>So aside from the aortic dissection its self, you could see a bleb of contrast sticking out. That could be an <strong>penetrating aortic ulcer</strong>. That is an atherosclerotic plaque that penetrates the internal elastic lamina of the aortic wall.<span class="citation" data-cites="ciccone2016">(<a href="references.html#ref-ciccone2016" role="doc-biblioref">Ciccone et al. 2016</a>)</span></p>
<p>Another key finding can be an <strong>intramural hematoma</strong> which is a hyper-dense crescent shaped hemorrhage within the aortic wall. There is no identifiable direct communication between the true and false lumen. IMH are classified in the same way but with the abbreviation IMH p-d zones.</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output-display">
<p><img src="images/thoracic_dissection2.png" class="img-fluid" width="470"></p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Whats the significance of these two in combination?</strong></p>
<p>There is a higher chance of aortic rupture if a penetrating aortic ulcer is seen with intramural hematoma.</p>
<p><strong>When a patient presents with an aortic dissection how can we classify them clinically?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Uncomplicated</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Stable hemodynamics</p></li>
<li><p>No evidence of malperfusion</p></li>
<li><p>Pain controlled</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Complicated</p>
<ul>
<li><p>End organ ischemia / malperfusjon</p></li>
<li><p>Rupture or impending rupture</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>High risk for early complication or continued growth<span class="citation" data-cites="vanbogerijen2014 reutersberg2018">(<a href="references.html#ref-vanbogerijen2014" role="doc-biblioref">Bogerijen et al. 2014</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-reutersberg2018" role="doc-biblioref">Reutersberg et al. 2018</a>)</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Uncontrollable pain / hypertension</p></li>

<li><p>Readmission</p></li>
<li><p>Radiographic only malperfusion</p></li>
<li><p>Entry tear on the lesser curve</p></li>
<li><p>Number vessels originating from false lumen and length of dissection.<span class="citation" data-cites="brunkwall2014 kamman2017 nienaber2009">(<a href="references.html#ref-brunkwall2014" role="doc-biblioref">Brunkwall et al. 2014</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-kamman2017" role="doc-biblioref">Kamman et al. 2017</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-nienaber2009" role="doc-biblioref">Nienaber et al. 2009</a>)</span></p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the danger of a false lumen? How does it lead to symptoms and malperfusion? Likewise which arteries commonly branch off the true lumen?</strong></p>
<p>The false lumen can lead to end organ ischemia as the intimal flap can cover the ostia of branching vessels. This can be a static or a dynamic obstruction.</p>
<p>Likewise it also leads to weakening in the wall of the aorta which can become a threatened rupture or rupture if the diameter of the false lumen is larger than 22mm.</p>
<p>The celiac trunk, SMA, right renal typically come of the true lumen. Left renal comes off the false.</p>
<p>Also the dissection most commonly goes down into the left common iliac rather than the right. You might be able to detect down stream effects of this on clinical exam with reduced left sided groin pulse.</p>
<p>The presence of multiple false lumens is associated with increased risk of aortic dissection related death.<span class="citation" data-cites="sueyoshi2013">(<a href="references.html#ref-sueyoshi2013" role="doc-biblioref">Sueyoshi et al. 2013</a>)</span></p>
<p><strong>What kind of patients get aortic dissections?</strong></p>
<p>Hypertension (older patients) / cocaine or Meth (younger patients)</p>
<p>Marfans, Loeys-Dietz, Ehlers Danlos Type 4, Turners, arteritis, Bicuspid aortic valve.</p>
<p>We also have a traumatic cause of aortic dissections. That being called blunt thoracic aortic injury:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Grade 1: intima tear</p></li>
<li><p>Grade 2: IMH</p></li>
<li><p>Grade 3: Pseudo aneurysm</p></li>
<li><p>Grade 4: Aortic rupture.</p></li>

<h3 data-number="4.1.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="evaluation"><span class="header-section-number">4.1.2</span> Evaluation</h3>
<p><strong>What is the workup?</strong></p>
<p>Physical Exam –Asymmetric pulses / blood pressure differences / Diastolic murmur,</p>
<p>Investigations - CXR, EKG, D-dimer + Troponin, CTA, ECHO for type A.</p>
<p>The big distinction is to find out if this is a type A or type B because the treatment strategy is completely different.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Type A need an emergent operation</p></li>
<li><p>Type B starts with medical management, follow up CT angiogram +/- Trans esophageal echo in the OR. Reevaluate at 24 hours.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="management" class="level3" data-number="4.1.3">
<h3 data-number="4.1.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="management"><span class="header-section-number">4.1.3</span> Management</h3>
<p><strong>What are the details of Type A treatment?</strong></p>
<p>Operative treatment. 30% op mortality. Cardiothoracics take the lead on this one. However vascular surgeons should be involved in the management of type A as after the repair, a type A can become a functional type B.</p>
<p>Type B is in the realm of vascular surgery. What is the first management step after we have diagnosed a type B dissection?</p>
<p>Invasive impulse therapy. That means redusing the force of transmitted impulse down the aorta. Blood pressure goals of 100-120mmHg. Hr &lt; 60bpm.</p>
<p><strong>How would you achieve that?</strong></p>
<p>Start with a beta-blocker (esmolol or labetalol) first then a vasodilator (nitroprusside). This is to stop the sympathetic surge after vasodilation that could increase pressure and thus tearing forces inside the aorta worsening the dissection.</p>
<p>Initial CT, 72 hours, 3 months x 4, q6 months x2, q12 month. (Descending thoracic aorta that dilates first.)</p>
<p><strong>Why isn’t open surgery indicated for type B dissections?</strong></p>
<p>Open surgery is not recommended due to the high mortality 30% if &lt; 48 hours. 18% if &gt; 49 hours.</p>
<p>In the acute setting mortality can be up to 50% with a 20% paraplegia risk. Its been described as sowing tissue paper.</p>
<p><strong>What is the management plan for a complicated Type B aortic dissection?</strong></p>
<p>Start with invasive medical management and plan for TEVAR. The goal with TEVAR being to direct the blood flow into the true lumen and seal the entry tear. If there was a dynamic obstruction (flap occludes branching vessels.) Then TEVAR would reestablish the true lumen hence removing the dynamic obstruction. Endovascular fenestration can also equalise the pressure in the true and false lumen. <span class="citation" data-cites="lombardiSTABLEIIClinical2020">(<a href="references.html#ref-lombardiSTABLEIIClinical2020" role="doc-biblioref">Lombardi, Gleason, et al. 2020</a>)</span></p>
<p>For a static occlusion there could be a thrombus or stenosis in the branched vessel so a stent might be indicated.</p>
<p><strong>What are the major risks of TEVAR in the management of Type B aortic dissections?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Retrograde type A (reported 2% in literature however it can be around 20% in some experiences). Carries a high mortality (ranging from 7-50%). Factors associated with retrograde dissection include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Over-sized endograft - every 1% over 9% results in an increase in retrograde dissection of 14%.<span class="citation" data-cites="canaud2014">(<a href="references.html#ref-canaud2014" role="doc-biblioref">Canaud et al. 2014</a>)</span></p></li>

<li><p>Paraplegia (reported around 5%)</p></li>
<li><p>Stent induced new entry.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is there a role for TEVAR in uncomplicated type B dissections?</strong></p>
<p>The INSTEAD and INSTEAD XL trials looked at uncomplicated Type B dissections. There was NO statistical difference at 2 years comparing OMT vs TEVAR but at 5 years there was good aortic remodeling and better long term survival in patients treated in the sub-acute stage.</p>
<p>Timing for TEVAR is a difficult choice. In chronic dissections the septum thickens leading to a potentially difficult TEVAR. Anecdotally, TEVAR is best at 2 weeks to 3 months.</p>
<p>It should be noted, that both the thoracic and abdominal aorta often continue to dilate even after repair so follow up surveillance is paramount.<span class="citation" data-cites="famularo2017">(<a href="references.html#ref-famularo2017" role="doc-biblioref">Famularo, Meyermann, and Lombardi 2017</a>)</span></p>
<p>If repair must extend into Zone 2, then pre-TEVAR carotid subclavian bypass should seriously be considered in elective/urgent inpatient setting to reduce the risk of periprocedural stroke (1.9% vs 14.3%).<span class="citation" data-cites="bradshaw2017 teixeira2017">(<a href="references.html#ref-bradshaw2017" role="doc-biblioref">Bradshaw et al. 2017</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-teixeira2017" role="doc-biblioref">Teixeira et al. 2017</a>)</span> Revascularization of the L subclavian with a L subclavian bypass is particularly important with a LIMA CAMB or a dominant L vertebral and a transposition is not appropriate.<span class="citation" data-cites="morasch2009 matsumura2009">(<a href="references.html#ref-morasch2009" role="doc-biblioref">Morasch 2009</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-matsumura2009" role="doc-biblioref">Matsumura et al. 2009</a>)</span></p>

<h3 data-number="4.2.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="anatomy-and-demographics"><span class="header-section-number">4.2.1</span> Anatomy and Demographics</h3>
<p><strong>Can you take us through the Crawford classification to start off?</strong></p>
<p>The Crawford classification is relatively recent, to be honest it was 1986.<span class="citation" data-cites="crawford1986">(<a href="references.html#ref-crawford1986" role="doc-biblioref">Crawford et al. 1986</a>)</span> And I think it was really important because it’s very practical classification, depending on body cavity and how to get to an aneurysm. It’s a bit old in terms of anatomy because they don’t really follow a pattern one would expect going one to four would be getting either more extensive or less extensive. And it’s not quite like that.</p>
<p>So type one is from the left subclavian down to just below the diaphragm. And that’s crucial because that distinguishes it from a thoracic aneurysm, which you can get to just from the chest and from a practical surgical approach. That’s a very important differentiating marker, but you have to go into a second cavity.</p>
<p>Type two is the biggie. So this is from the left subclavian all the way down to your bifurcation. So both abdominal and thoracic exposure, all the visceral, renal arteries and a lot of intercostal and lumbers. So big impact for cord supply, et cetera.</p>
<p>So three is for mid chest down to and involving the viscera, renals, and bifurcation. And that’s the one, which really is I suppose, the differentiator between whether you go for the full support that’s needed in a type two, or whether you can risk a clamp and go approach.</p>
<p>And type four is characterized by being in most patients accessible from the abdomen. I say in most patients, because there are some anatomical situations with body habitus, which means that going into the left chest is useful even for type four aneurysm.</p>
<p>Then type five. It was an additional classification that came in later, which is a bit like a type three at the top of the type one at the bottom effectively, but not everyone uses that.</p>
<p><strong>There appears to have been an increase in the incidence of thoracoabdominal aneurysms. Do you think it’s a true increase or does this relate to having scans for other reasons picked up by accident and then going on from that? What sort of many referrals do you get in a year and what’s your turn down?</strong> <strong>How many numbers are you actually doing in your practice year on year?</strong></p>
<p>So that’s interesting because the overall incidence of infrarenal atherosclerotic aneurysms is going down every year in the national UK vascular registry. And I suppose that is a legacy of the end of smoking for a big group of patients. I think thoracoabdominal aneurysms are going up partly because we are now imaging more and more people. and therefore we are imaging the chest and seeing them, which perhaps wasn’t the case, previously. So that’s an artificial increase in incidence, but also the rate of aortic dissection is on the rise, s chronic post dissection aneurysms are increasing. I think it’s a small group, but there is more knowledge about connective tissue disease and genetic studies and family screening, which perhaps is also a small part of annual increase. So over the next, 10, 20 years, certainly aneurysms are not going to go away. And that group of patients that have been affected are still around and there is a huge number now within the national UK screening program under surveillance for small animism, so it will come to fruition.</p>
<section id="etiology" class="level4" data-number="4.2.1.1">
<h4 data-number="4.2.1.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="etiology"><span class="header-section-number">4.2.1.1</span> Etiology</h4>
<p><strong>You’ve just touched on a bit of difference in the etiology between thoracoabdominal aneurysms and abdominal aortic aneurysm. So is there a huge difference in the etiology between these two type of aneurysm from your experience?</strong></p>
<p>On presentation, the majority of aneurysms are asymptomatic. So they’re found incidentally. It is rare that you get a symptomatic aneurysm. Some can get tender as they approach a time when the wall is going to breach pre rupture. I think thoracoabdominal aneurysms tend to be a bit more symptomatic than infrarenal. These are ones that go into the arch and present with hoarseness from recurrent laryngeal tension or bronchial compression.</p>
<p>There is a group that cause dilatation of the crus--I’ve seen, the crus of the diaphragm acts like an extrinsic wrap and it can be extremely tight at that point. These patients present with excruciating pain, radiating around their cost al margin. This is tension on the crus and it’s often not thought of as a sign of of an aneurysm, but I think in that group, it is. The larger the extent of aneurysm, things like weight loss and general poor health begins to become increasingly seen in that group with chronic aneurysms. So there are some subtle differences.</p>
<p>The other group that tends to occur, not in infrarenal aneurysms, is the post dissection aneurysms and the majority of those are known about. But there was a time when type A dissections, as in Stanford type one, which went all the way down were only monitored really with echo and the ascending. The rest was forgotten about, they got lost from cardiothoracic follow up. That group is a different group because we already know they’ve got an aneurysm. So there are subtle differences.</p>
<p>And then the connective tissue group, I suppose, is a bit different because they tend to have more extensive aneurysms rather than just confined to the infrarenal segment, which is by far and way, the most common for abdominal aneurysms.</p>
<p><strong>So you’ve mentioned a few different etiologies. Moving on to specifically thoracic aneurysms, you said a quarter of these are associated with dissection in the past, and a small portion will have underlying connective tissue disease. Do you think these patients will have a different threshold for intervention compared to the non-connective tissue disorder patients?</strong></p>
<p>I think we need to be aware that the connective tissue disorders we talk about—Marfan’s, Loeys Dietz, vascular Ehlers Danlos—are probably the tip of the iceberg of a number of other cases that we don’t have genetic sequencing for, but behave differently. The data from a dimention point of view is not quite as robust as one would hope, but the threshold that most people would agree for non connective tissue disorders would be about six centimeters. That takes into account the increased risks of operating both in the chest and the abdominal segment.</p>
<p>I think most people would agree that five centimeters is a better cutoff for connective tissue patients. Some cardiac surgeons would repair a young Marfan ascending aneurysm at four and a half centimeters. It does vary a little bit geographically, a bit like the threshold for infrarenal aneurysms, which varies between Europe, the States and the UK. So you’ve got to look at the patient in front of you and make a decision. I would certainly increase the threshold for someone who was not so fit and perhaps lower it a bit for a younger patient.</p>
<p>Also, be aware if it’s something odd anatomically—a saccular bulge, something where you think there could be a mycotic element—those are all very different you can’t be reassured by a dimension in an axial plane that is safe. These findings up the ante, in terms of whether you would pair at an earlier threshold. I’d include there a blowout for an eccentric penetrating aortic ulcer (PAU) or anything like that, which is not a conventional fusiform aneurysm.</p>
<p><strong>Can you talk us through the Ishimaru zones of the aorta and why do we need to know about these?</strong></p>
<p>Ishimaru was one of those useful classifications, there’s lots of classifications in medicine, but it’s nice to find one that’s actually got a use. This classification made sure that everyone was on the same page when reporting seals zones for thoracic devices. That is important for two reasons. 1) the extent of coverage and 2) the complications increased, the more proximally you go. The main complication for that is stroke. So historically, Ishimaru decided to classify these zones.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Zone 0</strong>, the first most proximal zone, is the ascending aorta up to and including the brachiocephalic trunk</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Zone 1</strong> is between the brachiocephalic trunk and including the left common carotid artery</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Zone 2</strong> is between the left common carotid artery and including the left subclavian artery</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Zone 3</strong> is the aortic segment just distal to the left subclavian artery.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Zone 4</strong>, added by some people, is distal to the T4 level, which is much lower down the thoracic aorta</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Most thoracic stenting will go really to zone three or perhaps into zone two. The more proximal you go, the more work needs to be done in terms of either extra anatomical debranching or using some form of fenestrated or branched arch device with an increase in stroke risk. What this allowed people to do is compare different series. You’re not just saying these were a group of TIVA patients, but you could define exactly how proximally they go.</p>
<p>And the same applies for the Crawford classification. It allows comparison within thoracoabdominal groups, and that’s important with both survival and complication rates. Because if your series is mainly extent 2 thoracoabdominal aneurysms, you’re going to have a very different outcomes from someone who’s got mainly type four aneurysms. Both classifications allow you to look at and compare data between groups.</p>

<p><strong>So if a patient has a thoracic aneurysm that affects their ascending aorta, we obviously involve the cardiac surgeons. The patient may require an elephant trunk procedure prior to intervention on the descending aorta. Can you briefly summarize the difference between a conventional elephant trunk and a frozen elephant trunk, and when to use one over the other?</strong></p>
<p>This is particularly pertinent to aortic dissection. The the main purpose of repair in Type A dissection is to protect the heart. People die of either rupture into pericardium causing tamponade or stripping the coronary ostia off and getting myocardial ischemia. So the priority of repair in acute ascending aortic dissection is primarily to protect the heart and to some extent for ensure a true lumen flow distally. Therefore, it was very popular because it was the least invasive to do a short interposition ascending repair, but that really left problems for later.</p>
<p>Therefore, as people became more adept with cardiac and cerebral protection, it became more popular to do a more extensive repair in the first sitting. This involves an arch repair and an acceptance that eventually the descending thoracic aorta will still need to be repaired, but at a later stage. Now you have to be aware that the ascending and arch is done from a median sternotomy, and it’s really difficult to get beyond the left subclavian form that position.</p>
<p>So when the arch was done, it was felt that the elephant trunk came from leaving an extra piece of dacron within the descending thoracic aorta in the true lumen of a dissection or in the main lumen of an aneurysm by a double sewing technique on the distal anastomosis and an inverting it. It would be left free and perfused in the descending, thoracic aorta. The benefit of that was when one came back to then do the descending thoracic segment via left thoracotomy, you could very quickly open the aorta and clamp that Dacron for a ready, made proximal anastomosis, which was much easier. It meant you didn’t have to grow up and dissect to the left subclavian with scar tissue and a previous anastomosis.</p>
<p>Now, what industry realized is that they could help with this procedure by actually facilitating a device which had three or four branches on a piece of Dacron, which was sized to be an arch replacement. There were ready-sewn 10 millimeter branches with an extra pipe for rewarming. These could then be sewn to be a innominate, carotid and subclavian and attached to that piece of Dacron was then a stent graft, which could then be placed distally in lieu of what was previously a floppy piece of Dacron.</p>
<p>And two manufacturers, JOTEC and Terumo Aortic, have made these devices, which facilitate and make things much easier. Therefore, so-called FET or frozen elephant trunk, has now become quite popular. I don’t quite know why it’s called frozen, but I think it perhaps means that the thoracic segment is stiff with a supported stent graft rather than just a floppy Dacron segment.</p>

<section id="isolated-thoracic-aneurysms" class="level4" data-number="4.2.2.2">
<h4 data-number="4.2.2.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="isolated-thoracic-aneurysms"><span class="header-section-number">4.2.2.2</span> Isolated Thoracic Aneurysms</h4>
<p><strong>So if we look at it at the isolated thoracic aneurysm, can you tell us briefly about the principle of TEVAR and what’s the optimal landing zone. Finally, in your opinion, is rapid ventricular pacing required when deploying these stents?</strong></p>
<p>So I think the isolated, thoracic aneurysm is a perfect application for TEVAR because it fulfills all those minimally invasive credentials—an endoluminal approach and if you can get a good seal zone, proximally and distally, it saves a thoracotomy and it’s a massive difference for the patients. Unfortunately I suppose those cartoons you see on the industry advertisements are vanishingly rare, when you’ve got a perfect proximal and distal landing zone and have really straight thoracic aorta.</p>
<p>I think for the majority of cases, you need a 2cm seal zone proximally and distally. However, if you have a torturous aorta, you likely need a longer seal zone. You want to land in an area where there is a good parallel walled walled segment. You have to be careful of so-called “bird-beaking” when a stiff, less conformable device lands perfectly on the outer curve, but holds off on the inner curve. This resultsin a lip, which protrudes and allows blood to get under that and cause stent graft crushing. I think modern devices have become much more conformable. We’ve learned the lessons of oversizing and the problems associated with oversizing. We’ve learned how to taper stent grafts when there’s mismatch between proximal and distal landing zones.</p>
<p>These have all significantly improved things, but there’s still no getting away from the fact that some anatomy is not well adjusted to the currently available stent grafts and Gothic arches are a particular problem. I’ve already mentioned torturous and large sacks, which allow a stent graft to move away from the center line to the outter curve.<span class="citation" data-cites="iwakoshi2019">(<a href="references.html#ref-iwakoshi2019" role="doc-biblioref">Iwakoshi et al. 2019</a>)</span> If that sac doesn’t shrink, you can imagine that draws on both the proximal and distal seals zone, and reduces them.</p>
<p>I think you can sometimes get away with a shorter landing zone. If, for example, you’re doing a post traumatic aneurysm where it’s only on one segment of the outer wall where there’s a problem. But for the vast majority of true aneurysms, you need that seal zone and you do need to oversize to achieve that.</p>
<p>You can go more proximally, and I think the majority of aneurysms at the left subclavian area, you can just drop the blood pressure to a systolic of 70 or 80 pharmacologically. Once you go more proximal to that, especially if you’ve got a custom device, with a scallop or branched device where you need an absolutely critical landing zone, you then really need to achieve a short transient period of circulatory arrest, either with adenosine, which is perhaps sometimes a bit unreliable, or rapid pacing.</p>
<p>Rapid Pacing can be difficult and does come with complications though, such as ventricular puncture. There are some newer techniques in terms of caval occlusion balloons, which basically stop venous blood returning to the heart with a reduction in output. Those are gaining popularity certainly in Germany and they can be quite effective for that. I think having tip capture on devices and better, more accurate deployment and better imaging does allow you to be more accurate in deployment, but there are still problems.</p>
<p>These devices have been inserted to very torturous iliac systems sometimes and they retain some energy. When you deliver them by removing that sheath, sometimes that energy is still there and they can jump forward as well as back. This can cause problems because you end up covering a vessel that you didn’t intend to.</p>
<p><strong>So you’ve just explained in detail that TEVAR is a great option for the majority of cases, but I presume you still believe there is a place for open repair in isolated, thoracic aneurysms, and why?</strong></p>
<p>I’m not so sure in isolated, thoracic aneurysms, unless for some reason they’re not suitable for TEVAR. I think if you’ve got problems with a mycotic aneurysm or a fistula into the bronchus or esophagus, these are our big problems with high mortality and your duty bound to go for open repair.</p>
<p>Patients with hemoptysis and a previous aortic repair should carry a high suspicion for an aortobronchial fistula. TEVAR is considered preferred repair, due to high morbidity and mortality with open repair. Bronchoscopy should be avoided due to high risk of rebleeding.<span class="citation" data-cites="bailey2011 léobon2002 quintana2006">(<a href="references.html#ref-bailey2011" role="doc-biblioref">Bailey et al. 2011</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-léobon2002" role="doc-biblioref">Léobon et al. 2002</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-quintana2006" role="doc-biblioref">Quintana et al. 2006</a>)</span></p>
<p>Certainly with connective tissue patients, open has advantages. In some unique situations it is possible to bridge between repairs. I think in some of the younger connective tissue patients, they will end up having certain segments repaired at different stages of their life. Although it’s probably now accepted that “all endovascular” is not a good option for these patients, if you’ve got Dacron proximally and distally already, bridging those segments with an endovascular device might work well. Although the Dacron will slowly dilate, it won’t dilate as much as aortic tissue in these patients. So there are options, but I think in reality, isolated, thoracic aneurysms on reasonable rare and TEVAR can be used for the majority of them.</p>

<section id="thoracoabdominal-aneurysms" class="level4" data-number="4.2.2.3">
<h4 data-number="4.2.2.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="thoracoabdominal-aneurysms"><span class="header-section-number">4.2.2.3</span> Thoracoabdominal Aneurysms</h4>
<p><strong>Moving on to thoracoabdominal aneurysms. Earlier we used the Crawford classification to describe the anatomical extent of the thoracoabdominal aneurysm. So let’s talk firstly, about type 1, 2, 3, and 5, which involved the thoracic of water to a greater or lesser extent as well as the abdominal aorta. We’ll come back to type four later on in this podcast.</strong></p>
<p><strong>So type 2 open thoracoabdominal aneurysm is arguably the most invasive operation a patient can undergo and carries 30 day mortality in excess of 10 to 15%. What is the size threshold for type two that you currently use in your practice and what is the evidence for this?</strong></p>
<p>So, as I suggested earlier, the evidence is that it’s a bit historical, and most people would actually say about six centimeters. I think that can be brought down a little bit for connective tissue patients and can go up a little bit for atheromatous patients. But in general, you’re talking about a younger segment of patients. This is not an operation for people in their eighties. Outcomes stratified by age greater than 50 found a higher rate of death, paraplegia, renal failure, cardiac complications and length of stay.<span class="citation" data-cites="coselli2017">(<a href="references.html#ref-coselli2017" role="doc-biblioref">Coselli et al. 2017</a>)</span> These patients need to be in very good shape because it is a big onslaught physiologically on them. It’s not just getting them off the table, it’s getting them out of intensive care and out of hospital and to recover back to their baseline.</p>
<p>I think that’s one of the things that can be really difficult about this disease. You are taking patients who are effectively functioning quite well, and they’re often relatively asymptomatic and you’re putting them through a prophylactic operation to try and prevent rupture, which no one quite knows if or when it’ll happen.</p>
<p><strong>So to that end, can you talk us through the decision making process when you’re assessing a patient with a thoracoabdominal aneurysm types 1, 2, 3, or 5?</strong></p>
<p>I think it is really dependent on anatomy, physiology, and the patient in front of you. Unfortunately, it is a bit of a bespoke assessment for an individual patient. So firstly, I think you have got to look at what are the options for that patient, which goes from conservative to endovascular, to open surgery.</p>
<p>The endovascular domain has changed hugely now with the increasing availability of branched devices. When I started, there weren’t custom devices. There were some FEVAR devices just coming out, and we did use long covered stents going through devices with TIVA above. However, there wasn’t the option for what we’ve now got from an endovascular perspective.</p>
<p>So I think you’ve got to choose the patients that are either unsuitable for endovascular, or are we really going to benefit from a durabililty of an open approach. Those are the two big differences, and they are differences. One, you’re going for gold standard approach because you think they’re life expectancy warrants that. The other one is much higher risk, because they haven’t got another endovascular option. These range from people with very tortuous anatomy, to difficult renal arteries, such as early divisions, that make them unsuitable as target vessels. Another reason is complex dissections, which are not suitable for an endovascular approach. Therefore, it is quite variable, but the first thing you must consider is whether this patient is going to get through this and get out of hospital. And that really is looking at them in the eye and considering what’s their quality of life or what’s their family support, and are they up for this?</p>
<p>The second one then is anatomical difficulties— Is there a shaggy aorta, atheromatous disease, or calcification of a target vessel, etc. Severe aortic wall thrombus is associated with solid organ infarction (24%), acute kidney injury, without dialysis (21%) and dealayed oral intake by 3.4d, however rarely resulted in mortality (0.5%).<span class="citation" data-cites="ribeiro2017">(<a href="references.html#ref-ribeiro2017" role="doc-biblioref">Ribeiro et al. 2017</a>)</span> Rarely is this a hundred percent or 0% decision, but it’s about building up relative contraindications. Some of them are pretty simple, like access problems for endovascular, and it’s a combination of those which then will sway you in one way or the other. And if anything, that decision-making is probably more pertinent for type three and type four, where there really is a different option and these patients are n their sixties and seventies with classic atheromatous disease. The really, young fit non-connective tissue patient with a type 2 TAAA is a rare beast.</p>
<p><strong>For connective tissue disease, many textbooks prefer an open approach over an endovascular approach do you still agree with this?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I do. I think certainly, what were you know about patients who’ve had total endovascular approaches for connective tissue diseases is that they don’t last. They may last five years or so and then you get progressive aortic dilatation and loss of those of seal zones. Whether that is the natural history of the native disease or whether it is regional force hooks, barbs or whatever is related to the device is unclear.</p>
<p>But when you sew these pensions and just touching the back end of a needle on the anterior wall can create a massive problem or just being a little bit clumsy and you get a radial tear. It’s very clear that a stiff device sitting in those aortas for many years with 60-70 beats per minute going through it and often hypertension, isn’t going last.</p>
<p>However there are some caveats, as I mentioned earlier, bridging between previous prosthetic open repairs is a possibility. And sometimes in a lifesaving situation, such as when someone has presented with a rupture, you may have to use an endovascular approach. However, be prepared then to treat that as a bridge and go back to do a definitive repair when things have calmed down and in the cold light of day.</p>
<p><strong>So we don’t really have the scope to dive into complex endovascular repair in this episode, but can you describe the broad principles of your operative approach to open thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair, type two, because it’s the most extensive?</strong></p>
<p>In terms of the patient, for anything juxtarenal or type four, I tend to have a patient supine on their back, but with a break in the table at the level between the costal margin and the anterior superior iliac spine. Breaking the table at that level, you can massively increase the exposure to that segment.</p>
<p>However, there are some patients even with a type four repair that demand a left thoracoabdominal incion. For a type four, if you’re doing a left thoracoabdominal approach, it’s usually for someone with a very narrow acute angle of the costal margin, such as a more petite frame female patient or a crus that is very high on the aorta. And if you look at CT scans, which is something I’ve realized over many years, that not everyone is the same. So where the celiac and SMA are can be in a different proportion, depending on where the costal margin and and skeleton is, which can make them easier or hard to get to. And certainly in a situation, if there is a rupture within the left side of the abdomen, you wouldn’t really want to go into that without getting proximal control. Because as you do the viceral rotation, you could have catastrophic bleeding.</p>
<p>So under those circumstances, I’d also go into the left chest with a reasonably low segment so that you can place a clamp ready before doing the visceral rotation. So for type four the one above then, the higher you go, the higher your thoracotomy and the more tipped over you need the patient. So for a type two, you’re going probably fifth intercostal space and the shoulders are at 90 degrees and the pelvis is 60 degrees. For type three, you’re slightly further over, so you’re down to about 60 degrees and you’re perhaps in the seventh intercostal space. So the lower you go, then right up to being pretty much supine.</p>
<p>The left arm is put over top. You mark the scapular and you go into the chest and abdomen. I tend to go intraperitonealy into the abdomen, so I can see the bowel, although there are people who do a retroperitoneal approach. I tend to divide the diaphragm down to the central ligament and mark that. Then effectively you are looking at your clamp zone. You dissect around your clamp zone, both proximally and distally. We don’t tend to expose the celiac and SMA in particular, or the right renal. It’s important to find the left renal artery. For the visceral rotation, you effectively extend the left colon up, find the white line and get under that and get right onto psoas. The key is to get right down on the psoas early on, and then it is a relatively bloodless field. Everything has taken me to leave the ureters out of the way. I always take for left kidney up. You will see in the textbooks and some advocate to keep the left kidney down. I that’s utter madness to be honest and I can’t see any point in it.</p>
<p>So for me, everything rotates up then out of the way. And it it looks a bit strange, like a postmortem. It looks very odd to see the whole left side abdominal cavity when all you’ve got is diaphragm muscle, psoas muscle and nothing else left. It does give you a very safe exposure then to the aorta. I don’t tend to go round the aorta with slings, I think that can cause problems. I go around with my fingers and be very aware of the right sided lumbers or intercostals because you really don’t want to cause a problem there because you easily get into the right chest from that exposure. So you have to be a bit careful so you can see exactly where you’re getting round.</p>
<p><strong>So in specifically with a type 2 TAAA, many people establish a left heart bypass. Do you always operate in that way and do you use a cardiac surgeon and the setting?</strong></p>
<p>I think type 2 you are mandated to have some sort of adjunct to keep the rest of the body perfused while you’re doing the proximal anastomosis. I think in an elective setting left heart bypass is the right way forward, because it does give you more flexibility and it allows you then to sequentially clamp and keep the legs, the viscera or the kidneys perfused. There are some negative aspects to left heart bypass, though, in terms of needing a much higher ACT and bleeding is the enemy here. The more you anti-coagulate, the more problems you’ve got. It’s also not pulsatile flow and you’re putting all your cells through a pump and you’ve got to be aware of increased problems around stroke and everything else that goes with that. I think it is very convenient for that set up, because you can get to the inferior pulmonary vein quite easily and femoral cannulation is quite easy for you to return and then you’ve got the option then of individually calculating celiac and SMA for perfusion, whereas usually renals are cooled down.</p>
<p>If you’ve got a perfusionist there as well, you can get cold perfusate for the renal arteries. So it gives you more flexibility, and if things go wrong, you’ve then got an option to switch to conventional bypass if needed or even drain out and go to circulatory arrest and cool-down.</p>
<p>So it does give you more options, however, in a more emergency setting, an approach that tends to work quite well for us is to do an ax-fem approach. You use an ax-fem graft onto the light subclavian artery, not tunneled but on the outside of a body onto the right femoral and use the other limb as a single cannula, usually for the SMA, because the SMA is the king vessel with all of this. Most of the other things can go, but if you lose the SMA, you’ve got a dead patient. And that allows you to do an emergency procedure, a mid type 3 approach, without some of the problems associated with left heart bypass. It allows you to have a lower ACT; it gives you pulsatile flow; you’re not smashing your cells up all the time; and it’s relatively quick and straightforward to do. You don’t have to mobilize a perfusionist and everything else that goes with that. It’s worked well for us in emergency settings. It’s better than a clamp and go approach because with a clamp and go approach, for the type 3 repair, you need to complete in 15 minutes, your inlay anastomosis at the top, the clock is already on. If you get down to the visceral segment and you’ve got to do some removal of thrombus to get your Corolla patch on or you’ve got to reimplant the left kidney separately, it’s a lot of time pressure and there’s no opportunity for something to go wrong there. That’s where this gives you a bit more breathing space that you’ve got the lower body perfused while you’re doing your proximal anastomosis.</p>

<h5 data-number="4.2.2.3.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="complications"><span class="header-section-number">4.2.2.3.1</span> Complications</h5>
<p><strong>As you’ve mentioned, open repair is a high tariff, high risk operation, but apart from death, are there any specific complications to the open approach?</strong></p>
<p>The big problems are bleeding and clamp times. Those are the things that cause problems for those patients who survive. So problems with large transfusion which cause problems with ventilation afterwards. The most common complications after a TAAA are pulmonary with 8.5% of one cohort requiring a tracheostomy.<span class="citation" data-cites="coselli2016">(<a href="references.html#ref-coselli2016" role="doc-biblioref">Coselli et al. 2016</a>)</span> Renal ischemia is an issue of people will quote a 40 to 50 minute renal warm ischemic time, you are then getting increasing problems with likely renal failure. They may need to go on the hemofilter for temporary support, but these patients have already lost a lot of nephrons, so they haven’t got a huge amount of capacity to lose more. That’s why eGFR or high creatinine is a really important prognostic marker of outcome in this patients. I think it’s like a barometer on their micro-circulation.</p>
<p>The big one and the Achilles heel of these approaches, whether it’s endovascular or open is spinal cord ischemia and that is because of the segmental of blood supply to the cord comes from all the intercostals and lumbers. If you’ve got that aneurysm extending both proximally and distally involving the internal iliacs the left subclavian, then you’re taking out your crucial collateral supply. And that is why trying to maintain blood supply, for example getting the lengths back in circuit early, whether that’s removing the large sheaths, during a long branched approach or getting the leg supply earlier in an open approach, and keeping the left subclavian in circuit. These are all other important things, paying attention to the mean arterial pressure in theater, have a spinal drain working, all of that is crucial in terms of trying to protect the cord as much as possible.</p>
<p>Post TEVAR leg weakness needs to undergo urgent evaluation. Differential diagnosis includes spinal ischemia due to subclavian or intercostal artery coverage, distal embolization or stenosis of the TEVAR graft. Stenosis should be treated with angioplasty and extension.<span class="citation" data-cites="buth2007">(<a href="references.html#ref-buth2007" role="doc-biblioref">Buth et al. 2007</a>)</span></p>
<p><strong>So the major issue is the spinal cord ischemia, and we mentioned briefly the blood supply of the spinal cord for the sake of the exam. Can you recap for us the blood supply of the spinal cord?</strong></p>
<p>Soit’s complicated actually. There are anterior and posterior spinal arteries, but I think depending on what level you are in the cord, they get a blood supply from a more dominant approach. So higher up in the cord—cervical and higher thoracic—vertebral arteries are important, so hence the importance of a left subclavian bypass.</p>
<p>The lower you go, then they become a bit less important and the actual segmental arteries, intercostals, become dominant. Much is talked about the artery of Adamkiewicz. I think, yes, there may be a dominant vessel at about that level, but it’s rarely one, absolutely single one that if you preserve that one, then the rest don’t matter. I think they all matter.</p>
<p>And then the more distally you go, collateral supply from internal lilacs, median sacral, all those contribute to a collateral circulation that should be seen in some ways all connected. And that is why, more recently in endovascular approaches, staging repair is really useful because you can allow the surviving arteries then to remodel and increase flow. It’s why, during a type 2 repair, when you get the whole aorta open, it’s very important to block the intercostals early—either by sewing them off or putting a little Pruitt balloon in and to stop losing blood from that collateral supply. It keeps the pressure in the spinal cord. Also that’s why, the differential position of that blood supply is why patients then get a particular form of problem with motor problems and sometimes preservation of sensation.</p>
<p><strong>So purely for exam purposes and a bit of physiology. Can you remind us how to calculate the spinal cord perfusion?</strong></p>
<p>All that is really is map minus the CSF pressure. So it’s your mean arterial pressure, take out the CSF pressure and that’s what you’ve got perfusing the spinal cord. It is a useful equation to remember because it allows you to decide what’s the way to enhance spinal perfusion as much as possible, and that is to increase MAP and decrease your CSF pressure. We do that by enhancing the mean arterial pressure as much as possible, and draining off CSF with a spinal drain to reduce your CSF pressure and allow more blood into the cord.</p>
<p>I think people perhaps get a bit hung up on spinal drainage and it’s importance. It is just as important to maintain oxygenation and hemoglobin over a hundred, reduce blood loss and all those other things are as crucial. Spinal drainage is an adjunct, but it shouldn’t be seen in isolation. It’s one of many adjuncts to try and help prevent spinal ischemia.</p>
<p><strong>So in regards to the mechanism for spinal cord ischemia during open thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair, do you think it’s related the blood loss, clamp time or or implantation of the intercostals?</strong></p>
<p>I think it’s multifactorial. So I think the majority is due to ischemia scheme in terms of a watershed situation. Segments of a cord just not getting enough blood. And the very reason the more typical area around T7, 8, 9, to 10, is because it is in the middle between the vertebral and internal iliac artery supply. This is probably a kin to a splenic flexure of the colon, it’s between two territories.</p>
<p>However, there is also potentially problems with microemboli or trashing of a spinal arteries, which can occur in some patients. It’s a slightly confusing situation, but I think in terms of intraoperatively, blood loss, dumps in blood pressure, with hypotensive episodes really don’t help. When do you remiplant? Again, that is a bit confusing. Some people would argue if there’s massive back bleeding, you don’t need to be reimplant because they’re getting collateral supply from somewhere.</p>
<p>I think it will depend on how the case is going. We do use motor evoked potentials (MEPs) but that’s quite a specialist situation and you’re very reliant on the readings you get. They can be confused by leg ischemia, cooling down or edema. But if you have already got the legs back in circuits and got the MAP up and things weren’t improving and there was a sizable intercostals that could be reimplanted, well, then that’s worth doing. And that’s why the technique of using Pruitt balloon occlusion methods in pairs rather than ligating is good because you can then just reimplant those. If you don’t need to implant them, you can just ligate and remove them. Whereas if you’ve already ligated them, you’ve got a problem because you’ve already destroyed the ostia. We tend to leave a branch already attached in the mid thoracic aorta to save an anastomosis. You can, if you’ve got really good intercostals, fillet the branch to open it up and sew it on like a long patch longitudinally along the paired intercostals and then plumb it back on the other end so it’s a circuit in series with your main aortic graft. That probably decreases the resistance to flow and that might remain patent for a bit longer, rather than having a big 10mm graft going into a single pair of intercostals with what are likely to have quite a high resistance, and they probably don’t last as long.</p>
<p>Severe spinal protocols have been described to reduce risk of spinal ischemia or mitigate the impact of spinal ischemia in patients who develop weakness.<span class="citation" data-cites="estrera2009 yanase2012">(<a href="references.html#ref-estrera2009" role="doc-biblioref">Estrera et al. 2009</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-yanase2012" role="doc-biblioref">Yanase et al. 2012</a>)</span> An easy way to remember the important components are COPS:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>C - Cerebral spine drain status - keep for 7 days, pressure less than 5</p></li>
<li><p>O - Oxygen delivery - supplemental oxygen, increase hgb, increase cardiac index</p></li>
<li><p>PS - Patient Status - Keep BP greater than a MAP of 90mmHg</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>So do you think we’re good at predicting preoperatively who may get spinal cord ischemia? You mentioned a few risk factors already that can predict who will or won’t post-operatively.</strong></p>
<p>I think we’re utterly hopeless at it actually. I really don’t think that there’s a good method. You can see people having an infrarenal repair getting paralysis and you can completely replace the whole aorta from the arch down to the iliacs with prosthetic and have people walking around without a problem at all. So I don’t really understand it and I think that comes into the business about whether it is about emboli, flow, or collaterals. I think it’s a combination of things. When people started embolizing intercostals preoperatively prior to endo repairs, people thought this is a man thing—you want to keep them perfused surely. But I think it does show the importance of maximizing the collateral supply, and I think some people have a better collateral supply than others. And of course, what we don’t know is when you get down to the more microscopic level of actual arterial supply at cord level, what that is like in an inidividual patient. You can’t see on imaging. If that is already compromised, I suspect those patients are more at risk than whether they have a macro vascular problem when things go wrong terms of hypotension or blood loss.</p>
<p>Many reports state that the highest risk factor for spinal cord ischemia includes length of aortic coverage or repair, followed by whether they have had a prior repair, preop hemoglobin, and intraoperative hypotension.<span class="citation" data-cites="bisdas2015">(<a href="references.html#ref-bisdas2015" role="doc-biblioref">Bisdas et al. 2015</a>)</span></p>
<p><strong>We haven’t really touched on complex endovascular repairs yet, but can you explain when you might choose a hybrid approach to this thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair?</strong></p>
<p>So visceral hybrid operation came in really as a bridge between open surgery and endovascular. This is a bit dated now, because it is before custom devices and we only had thoracic stents at this time, the era of the Talent stent, which was a very early thoracic device made by Medtronic. Perhaps not the perfect name because it wasn’t a particularly talented, it was a difficult thing to deploy, but it actually got us into the thoracic aorta. What we realized was that if you could operate in one cavity, such as the abdomen, but still excluding any aneurysm in the chest without cross camping and without rendering that patient ischemic over a large part of their body—they could withstand that hit much better than open cavity surgery with cross clamp and massive reperfusion.</p>
<p>So the concept of a visceral hybrid was to do an extra-anatomical bypass of the celiac, SMA and both renals from either the distal aorta or the iliac vessels. So patients would only get sequential ischemia of one organ at a time, say the right kidney or the celiac territory, and during that 10 minute anastomosis, the remainder of the body and organs were refused. And finally, at the end that, you could then put in a thoracic device as a freebie, because you’d already perfused the organs from distally. You’d ligated those target vessels and then you would just excluding the aneurysm so that you were transferring blood from above the repair to below the repair and retrogradely perfusing the vital organs.</p>
<p>So it was very attractive and we started doing it quite early at St. Mary’s and initially we had some very good results in the first 30 or so patients. And as always, then it allowed you to consider older, sicker patients but it wasn’t easy surgery. And actually I think because it was doable in terms of just an abdominal approach and relatively familiar territory for anyone who’s done occlusive disease for the viscerals or renals, I think a number of centers started doing small numbers and not getting so good results. And then when better, custom made devices came in, I think it’s purpose became less and less because why would you do that if you had an opportunity to do something which was even less invasive.</p>
<p>So what we’ve been left with now to consider a hybrid type approach effectively are those patients who are physiologically not fit enough for an open approach and those patients who are anatomically not suitable for a total endovascular approach. In some ways, they are the worst of both worlds in that outcome group. And so I don’t think you’ll ever be able to compare outcomes legitimately with the fitter group having a fully open approach and the anatomically suitable patients having a total endovascular.</p>
<p>But I must say we still see quite a lot in our multidisciplinary reviews coming back. What surprises me is the durability of those grafts. The visceral grafts remain patent for many years, some of them are 15 years now. Occasionally there will be an accessory or small diseased renal artery, and the renal grart will go down, but the others have been extremely durable. And even though we’ve had to re-line the stenting portion or extend it, the grafts have maintained really well.</p>
<p>A unique situation that uses a similar technique is with mycotic aneurysms of the visceral segment of the aorta. The mainstay of treatment is a debranching of the aorta and debridement of the infected aorta with in situ revascularization or ax fem-fem bypass. There is an evolving role for FEVAR, such as with most aneurysmal disease.<span class="citation" data-cites="sörelius2016 sule2016">(<a href="references.html#ref-sörelius2016" role="doc-biblioref">Sörelius et al. 2016</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-sule2016" role="doc-biblioref">Sule and Dharmaraj 2016</a>)</span></p>
<p>S<strong>o moving on to Type IV thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair. These can be repaired using endovascular or open techniques. Can you talk us through your approach to open Type IV repair in terms of exposure and any tips such as how to minimize the visceral ischemia?</strong></p>
<p>So I think an open Type IV from a subcostal approach is a doable and durable procedure. And what I mean by that is that the hit to the patient is not enormous, and a reasonably fit patient can get through that reasonably well. You have to be a little bit selective, but not super selective. For example, in my first hundred, I had one 30 day death and one in hospital death, which was someone at about three months who just didn’t get better, so that puts it into perspective that actually it’s an operation with a very good outcome, if you get it right at the beginning.</p>
<p>The approach I mentioned earlier, nothing too special. This is a supine patient. Getting the break on the table in the right position to allow you to extend the abdomen. You lower both ends of a table to open up that segment of the abdomen and get better exposure. I tend to do the vast majority via a subcostal approach, some people would call it rooftop, then extending on the left side down below the costal margin a bit. And it gives you really good exposure even if you have to go down to the iliacs. It does cause a bit more of a problem getting to the right iliac bifurcation. The left is easy, because it’s right there next to you. So that’s an added complication.</p>
<p>The visceral rotation needs to be done carefully because what you do not want is to create blood loss right at beginning. And as I mentioned earlier, it’s getting under the left colon along the white line onto psoas and then getting up under psoas and I always tell the registrars when they’re doing it, you’ve got to go as far as possible on psoas from below. And when you think you’ve gone as far as possible, you’ve got to go another five centimeters. So you get right up to the diaphragm from below. And then you can get into the supra-colic compartment around the splenic flexure and get your fingers either side of the lienorenal ligament and take that off the lateral and the posterior abdominal wall. The more and more you do, the more you are freeing and the whole of the viscera comes up towards the right side of a patient and eventually they will rotate up and you’ve exposed the whole left wall of the aorta.</p>
<p>The first thing I then do is ensure that I’ve got a clamp zone, and I do that by dividing the crus which sometimes can be really tense at that level. The crus can act as an extrinsic wrap around the dilated aorta, to an extent that the distal end of the crus is almost ligamentous, causing a tight band on the aorta. I tend to get my finger underneath that before it with a diathermy and opening it, and then very carefully choosing the clamp zone and getting my fingers right round that area, so I know I’ve got a healthy clamp zone.</p>
<p>The next thing I then do is look for the left renal artery. I’ve already tended to make a decision about what I’m going to do with the left renal artery, which depends on the number of things. So it depends on, to some extent, the age of a patient, where the left renal is in terms of a clock face. So if you’re looking at an axial cut to the CT, the more the loft renal is around before three o’clock, up to two o’clock, the easier it is to incorporate because you’ve got less aortic tissue there. Once you’re beyond 3:30, round to four o’clock, it’s quite a long way away and it’s quite posterior on the sidewall of the aorta, or if the left renal i smore distal compared to the right renal. What that means is then it’s a long way away from the right renal artery, which means you’re going be leaving a larger patch of aorta. This is usually bad news, unless you have a more elderly patient.</p>
<p>You’re making this decision about whether you’re going to try and incorporate the left renal artery into a big big patch or whether you’re going to reimplant it separately or perform a jump graft. So you’ve already thought about that, but it’s crucial to find the left renal because when you’ve clamped and you’ve done your left aortotomy, you’ve got to get that aortotomy underneath and posterior to the left renal artery so that the orifice goes up with that segment of the aorta.</p>
<p>Then I tend to get the iliacs out. The left is easy, it’s there. I have no qualms on the right by going back over through the peritoneum to find the right iliac artery to expose that. I don’t go around any of them. I just find a very discrete camp zone. You don’t need much, just literally enought to put a clamp on.</p>
<p>And then I tend to take the fat and lymphatic tissue off the left side of aorta. So when you open the aorta, you’ve not got a lot of immediate bleeding. If you’ve got a retro-aortic left renal vein, you’ve got a line gate that cause otherwise you’d be going through it. And surprisingly, on CT, the main left renal vein is anterior, but there is often a vein there which has stretched across, either a lumbar or phrenic vein, which you should deal with prior to your aortotomy.</p>
<p>It’s about getting everything set up before you cross clamp, because once you cross clamp, the clock is on. So it’s getting the whole team ready for that moment and making your anatomy as perfect as possible before you do that. Obviously it goes without saying that you have cell salvage and we use a Belmont with the big bucket on the top of it, so that you can rapidly give blood back when you need it.</p>
<p><strong>Can you talk a little bit more about a Carrel patch and when would you choose to do a jump graft to the left renal rather than encompass all the vessel vessels onto that patch?</strong></p>
<p>I tend to think of a Carrel patch more in a way with a type 3 repair, because with a type 3 repair, you’ve done your proximal anastomosis and then what you’re doing is you’re putting on a patch of aorta to include the celiac, SMA, and right renal, which tend to be together, whereas sometimes the left renal is a bit away. The more tissue you leave there, the more chance that aortic tissue will dilate to over time, hence the patch aneurysm. If your patient has got some form of connective tissue disease, we tend to reimplant directly.<span class="citation" data-cites="derango2011 afifi2017">(<a href="references.html#ref-derango2011" role="doc-biblioref">De Rango et al. 2011</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-afifi2017" role="doc-biblioref">Afifi et al. 2017</a>)</span> There is a very nice graft available with four side bunches already put on and you can go straight onto the ostia. So you’re basically leaving no aortic tissue at all.</p>
<p>For type four, you are doing an oblique anastomosis and you have to be aware that the right side of the aorta is really left there. It’s a compromise, these patients with atherosclerotic type aneurysms, they may be in their sixties, seventies or even into their eighties. Even the good candidates, they’re not going to live 25-30 years, and therefore over time that segment may begin to dilate a bit. I think that is acceptable. Half of that segment is Dacron and the other bit may dilate.</p>
<p>I think if you’ve got a Carrel patch, which really balloons out, that’s something which is different. We don’t have good dates as to when those will give away and rupture. I think what is clear is that if you’ve got dehiscence between your suture line and your graft, that is a dangerous situation, akin to a false aneurysm. And although it may look similar on CT, that’s a different beast and they’re at risk at any stage. True aneurysmal dilation of a segment that is left behind is a bit different and I think that’s a bit safer. In essence, what you’re trying to do is a compromise between leaving as little aortic tissue as possible, but also getting the patient alive through their first repair safely.</p>
<p>If I know I’m not going to incorporate a left renal, then I will sew on a six or eight millimeter side branch onto the tube golf before I cross clamp, because that saves you one anastomosis. And then now my favorite technique is just to amputate the left renal artery and sew that directly onto your branch and leave that in a bit of a lazy C configuration in the paracolic gutter, so as the rotation comes back, it’s not under tension. The other technique is to have very short graft, right from your aortic prosthetic, but you’ve got to really judge how that will sit when the kidney is back in its anatomic position. So it can’t come off the anterior aspect of the tube graft. It needs to be further down and that’s awkward to judge and I think we’re probably not good at that so the lazy C is a better approach.</p>
<p>I much prefer that to trying to either reimplant the native artery directly onto the Dacron, as they tend to restenose or try to bring the aortic sidewall down on to the Dacron. I think that’s fraught with difficulty. You’ve often got calcification at the ostium, and it’s also very difficult because you’ve got the rest of your anastomosis really close and sometimes not enough room to bring your clamp down, which is exactly what you want to do. The left kidney will take a bit of an extra ischemic hit, but you want to be perfuse the right renal and viscera. You’ve got to have to bring your camp down below your proximal anastomosis.</p>
<p>When it comes to late complications from TAAA repair, 8% are from progression of aortic disease and 3% are related to the graft repair. Risk factors associated with late events include female sex, partial aneurysm resection, expansion of remaining native aorta or initial aneurysm rupture.<span class="citation" data-cites="clouse2003">(<a href="references.html#ref-clouse2003" role="doc-biblioref">Clouse et al. 2003</a>)</span></p>
<p><strong>Have you ever had to treat the Carrel patch aneurysm in your career?</strong></p>
<p>We have a number from previous Type 3 repairs and I think these are very suitable for fenestrated or branched devices. You’ve got a beautiful lending zone, proximally and distally. Why not? These tend to be well-suited to that and it’s a much easier approach mixing endo and open, changing from one to the other, I think that’s fine. It’s just at a different stage of a patient’s life and repair</p>
<p><strong>Any final summary or closing words about aortic surgery?</strong></p>
<p>We have a bit of a tipping point with open aortic surgery at the moment, certainly in the UK. Looking at registry data, many are tipping back to open now. Whether that was as a result of NICE guidelines, I suspect not, perhaps that just put it more into focus. I think many people are seeing more problems with patients surviving after what was very good endovascular surgery at the time, but they’ve outlived the repair. Now we’ve got problems with patients where you got to wonder whether that wasn’t perfect anatomy and should they have had open surgery?</p>
<p>Now the difficulty we’ve got at the moment is the patients that perhaps weren’t that suited for endovascular repair, did well initially from it and they are paying the price later on. But those very patients are the ones that are also more difficult from an open approach. They are patients with shorter, more tortuous necks or more calcification. There is a concern that there is an era of surgeons now that haven’t done as much open aortic surgery, who may not be as confident with adverse anatomy.</p>
<p>That lack of confidence influences your decision-making, so patients don’t get a full appraisal of what options are available. The default then may be to go with a less than perfect and endovascular option. I agree, this may be less easy to kill a patient upfront with an endo option but you perhaps pay for that later on. This is a very difficult thing to get around and we’ve got to get to a compromise of finding the patients with the likely better life expectancy and sending them to groups with a larger open practice and get them through a big operation safely and capitalize on those benefits.</p>
<p>The really lucky ones are the ones that are anatomically really suited for endovascular repair and their sack really shrinks and their seal zones remain good. They are the best of both worlds as they tend to also be fitter with less extensive disease and get the benefits from a less invasive approach. Not all patients are the same and we’ve got to now accept that we’ve gone down the line of working with industry, which they didn’t necessarily focus on durability. What they wanted to do is to extend the applicability, to treat more patients and get better, lower profile devices to go for these percutaneous cardiology market in the United States. And we’re now paying the price of some of those decisions, so we’ve got to reboot and take a stance on which patients are going to actually benefit from which approach and have a better evaluation of that going forward.</p>

<p><strong>What are the common genetic aortopathies?</strong></p>
<p>There are several well-known genetic disorders which account for genetic aortopathies. The most well-known are Marfan syndrome, Loeys-Dietz Syndrome, and Vascular Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome,</p>
<p>There are less commonly known ones such as Familial Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms and Dissections due to pathogenic variants smooth muscle cells genes such as <em>ACTA2</em>. There are others in which the causative gene is not known.</p>
<p><strong>Why are they such a big deal?</strong></p>
<p>These are cases in which the building blocks of the aortic wall are defective. What I mean by this, is that these patients have pathogenic variants in the genes that affect cell signaling or smooth muscle cell structure that lead to suboptimal composition of the aortic wall. These alterations ultimately lead to cystic medial necrosis in the aortic wall.</p>
<p>As such they are at more risk for aortic aneurysms and dissections that can lead to the premature death of the patient.</p>
<p>To put the frequency in perspective, Marfan syndrome occurs in 1:5000 of the population while Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (also known as VEDS) occur in 1:50000 of the population.</p>
<p><strong>Let’s dive into them then – what are the defining features of each and the high yield information?</strong></p>
<p>The high yield information is being able to pair the genetic syndrome and phenotype with its associated genetic mutation. A useful exercise following this broadcast is to list the disorders in a table and write out their associated gene mutation, what protein defect or deficit occurs, the typical phenotype, and the common vascular pathology associated.</p>
<p>But before we dive in, I want you to keep in mind some of shared features. One is that the associated aneurysms and dissections tend to occur at younger ages and dissect at lower blood pressures than what we see with sporadic dissections (these are the dissections that are not familial or associated with a syndrome)</p>
<p>One is that these are inherited in an autosomal dominant matter but there can be variation in how the pathogenic variants are expressed among affected people and even within families. The other thing to remember, is that in roughly half of these cases, the affected patient is the first in their family to have a given pathogenic mutation. The flip side of this, is in half the cases, there is a family history of aortic aneurysms, dissections, and sudden death.</p>
<p><strong>We will start with Marfan syndrome.</strong></p>
<p><u>Marfan syndrome</u> is caused by pathogenic variants in the <em>FBN1</em> gene (also known as fibrillin-1 gene). These variants lead to improper formation of the microfibrils that maintain elastin, a key component of the arterial wall.</p>
<p>These patients are prone to aneurysmal degeneration and dissections of the aortic root but can also dissect the descending thoracic aorta. They commonly have lens dislocations (ectopia lentis). They have common skeletal features such as</p>
<p>being tall, thin, with long arms and legs, scoliosis, pectus deformities (carnitatum or exicavtum), and club feet. They can also have a history of spontaneous pneumothoraces and mitral valve prolapse.</p>
<p><strong>How is Marfan syndrome similar or different from the other genetically triggered aortopathies that you mentioned?</strong></p>
<p><u>Loeys Dietz Syndrome</u> is similar to Marfan syndrome in all the features including the aortic root aneurysms. They don’t seem to have lens dislocation and they have other unique features such as bifid uvula or cleft palate, and hypertelorism (which is an abnormally increased distance between the eyes). What is different about Loeys Dietz Syndrome from Marfan syndrome is that they can have arterial aneurysms of other arteries instead of the aorta, such as the SMA, axillary, or other peripheral arteries.</p>
<p><u>Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome</u> has some shared features to Marfan Syndrome with both such as spontaneous pneumothoraces, but these patients tend to be short and can have easy bruising. They also have similar features to Loeys Dietz syndrome in terms of arterial aneurysms. Common features of VEDS would be thin translucent skin where you can easily see their veins, thin lips, thin bridge of the nose, large eyes, easy bruising, acrogeria – or an aged appearance of the hands</p>
<p>However, unlike Marfan and Loey Dietz, the majority of VEDS patients tend to not have aortic root aneurysms. One thing to remember about VEDS is that it is a <em>subtype</em> of Ehlers Danlos syndromes. It’s very important to distinguish it from the other subtypes because most of the other 12 Ehlers-Danlos syndromes are not associated with arterial pathology. So people with vascular EDS are prone to arterial, uterine, and intestinal rupture and their average lifespan is 48 due to these highly morbid pathologies. 25% of patients with vEDS will have experienced some clinical manifestation by age 20, and that number is close to 90% by age 40.</p>
<p><strong>I remember learning about classic Ehler’s Danlos presenting with hypermobile skin and joints. Is this something you see with Vascular EDS as well?</strong></p>
<p>Patient’s with vEDS don’t have the same hypermobile skin or joint laxity as we classically think of with classic Ehler’s Danlos. In fact, some vEDS patients report losing confidence in their physicians who ask them about joint and skin hypermobility because it suggests to them that their doctor doesn’t know about their disease process. These patients often know more than most of the doctors they meet about their condition, and it’s a source of constant frustration for them. It can also be a problem if the severity of the disease is underestimated, as we discussed they can present much younger than most patients with highly morbid issues – like arterial rupture.</p>
<p><strong>You mentioned arterial pathology in Loeys Dietz and VEDS. Can you tell me more about that?</strong></p>
<p>In both types you can see subclavian, carotid, SMA, and iliac artery aneurysms and dissections, as well as less frequently vertebral, SFA, and popliteal aneurysms and dissections.</p>
<p><strong>How do you diagnose these genetically triggered aortopathies?</strong></p>
<p>There are clinical diagnostic criteria for each, but ultimately genetic and laboratory testing is very important for the final diagnosis.</p>
<p>Ghent’s criteria is used to clinically diagnose Marfan’s syndrome. The big ones are aortic root dilation, known family history of Marfan’s or not, the diagnosis of ectopia lentis which clinically is manifested as iridonesis (lens shimmering). Additionally, genetic testing for pathogenic FBN1 variants is also diagnostic.</p>
<p>To date, there are 5 types of Loeys-Dietz as of last check. These are due to pathogenic variants in the TGF-B signaling pathway, such as TGF-beta receptors and SMAD3 genes.</p>
<p>Vascular EDS is caused by a mutation in the COL3A1 gene which encodes a defective type of III procollagen. The defect in the procollagen makes it unable to properly fold into a triple helix that forms the normal collagen structure. This causes the defective procollagen to be degraded intracellularly and as a result there is an overall deficit in type III collagen which is an important component of arterial walls and other structures. The confirmatory test for VEDS is collagen testing which can confirm the collagen III defect.</p>
<p><strong>How would you manage these patients?</strong></p>
<p>Medical optimization and surveillance is key to try to extend the time as much as possible before they get a dissection and avoid it if at all possible.</p>
<p>We start with lifestyle modification. Avoid “burst” exertions such as sprinting and weight-lifting. Anything that very strenuous. That’s not to say that they shouldn’t exercise. Light exercise is encouraged, but this would be activities like light jogging, swimming laps, or biking.</p>
<p>In order to minimize aortic shear stress, a resting heart rate of under 70 beats per minute and an exercising heart rate under 100 should be the goal. This can be accomplished with beta blockers. Propranolol has been shown to significantly decrease the rate of aortic growth in Marfans patients with a baseline aortic root diameter under 4cm. There is research into the use of Losartan in murine models that suggests it inhibits TGF-beta in the aortic wall, which is an important pathway that contributes to the breakdown of the wall. However, randomized controlled studies have failed to show an increased benefit of Losartan over beta blockers in Marfans patients. ACE inhibitors are also being tested and are shown to decrease the risk of type b aortic dissection over 6 years.</p>
<p>In vascular EDS instead of propranolol, celiprolol has been studied by the French and shown to reduce vascular rupture from 50 down to 20% in vEDS, although the mechanism of this is not yet clear and does not appear to be necessarily the same as decreasing shear stress as in Marfan’s syndrome. In general taking care of these patients involves trying to minimize complications from procedures and interventions. For instance, use ultrasound for any line that is necessary and avoid arterial lines, intramuscular injections, or other invasive lines if possible to minimize the chance of a complication. Patients are advised to wear medical bracelets notifying that they have vEDS.</p>
<p>We also discuss the importance of forming a care team based on their needs. This usually includes a cardiologist, a cardiac surgeon, a vascular surgeon, and a primary care physician.</p>
<p><strong>What about surgical treatment for those who need it?</strong></p>
<p>For patients with Marfan’s, prophylactic surgery is recommended for aortic root dilation &gt;5cm or thoracic aorta &gt;5.5cm. Often times the thoracic and abdominal aorta are involved. Open and endovascular surgery are options for these patients. Open procedures often include open thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repairs, open cardiac surgery for arch replacement, or cervical debranching procedures. Endovascular procedures can include regular TEVARs or branched TEVARs which require extensive aortic coverage. Open surgery can be well tolerated and is ideal in the sense that you can replace the entire aorta which avoids the future complications from continued aneurysmal degeneration, loss of proximal or distal seal zones, or device issues that can plague endovascular methods. However open surgery, of course caries higher complication risk and morbidity up front and does share some complications with endovascular treatments as well. Sometimes these patients will have hybrid procedures and often their care will require multiple surgery teams including cardiac and vascular surgery. An important thing to be up front with all of these patients about is that this is a long term relationship with their surgeon, as they often require multiple staged procedures, things aren’t fixed in one procedure, and even after they have been surgically addressed there is a lifetime of maintenance and surveillance. Ultimately, the decision for open vs.&nbsp;endovascular approaches will vary between patients based on their specific anatomy and arterial issues, what their body can tolerate, and ultimately what their goals of care are.<span class="citation" data-cites="lumEndovascularProceduresPatients2012a">(<a href="references.html#ref-lumEndovascularProceduresPatients2012a" role="doc-biblioref">Lum et al. 2012</a>)</span> Some may require having their entire aorta replaced, while others may only need ongoing medical therapy and surveillance and it’s important to set expectations early.</p>
<p><strong>What about VEDS, when surgery cannot be avoided? How do you mitigate the risk of complications?</strong></p>
<p>The tissue is very fragile. So using instruments that are the least traumatic is key – like fogarty clamps for vessels. Sutures often must be pledgetted to reinforce them. Leave no tension on anastomoses or suture lines. Always keep a backup plan in mind– when arteries cannot be repaired, can they safely be ligated or embolized? Generally any large bore access for endovascular treatment is avoided because access site complications are high and can lead to devastating consequences. In situations of extremis, like a rupture, these patients’ tissues have been known to completely breakdown. Try to avoid the worst case scenario, but of course sometimes it’s the only option left to get out of the OR. Be upfront with the patient about how complications may arise, set expectations, and think about goals of care early.</p>
<p><strong>We discussed earlier that these aortopathies can have shared phenotypic characteristics, some of which can be used in a clinical diagnosis, but are all of these genetic aortopathies syndromic?</strong></p>
<p>Let’s start by saying that all patients with Marfan syndrome and VEDS can have the syndromic features we just talked about. However, it’s not always the case and the absence of these feature does not exclude the diagnosis. In fact, we recently treated a middle-aged woman with an aortic dissection who had Marfan Syndrome confirmed with genetic testing. She had been diagnosed prior to her dissection because her daughter had undergone genetic testing. However, on meeting her, I would not have guessed she had Marfan Syndrome, had I not known. She was average height, obese, and had no other relevant physical findings on exam or history.</p>
<p>This ties into another genetic aortopathy that we have not discussed yet which are the familial thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections. They do not have any syndromic features. For example, patients with ACTA2 pathogenic variants that cause alpha actin mutations which again contribute to degeneration of the arterial wall. These patients tend to present 10 years younger than sporadic thoracic aortic aneurysms, generally in their late 50s compared to late 60s, and women seem to be less often effected than men.</p>
<p><strong>Dr.&nbsp;Shalhub, I know vascular genetics is one of your passions. Is there anything else you want people to remember from this broadcast?</strong></p>
<p>Don’t forget the family. Once you’ve made the diagnosis in one of them, remember it is autosomal dominant, so it’s important to make sure the family understands and that they are set up with the appropriate care team and monitoring. They may not all develop the same medical issues, however as we discussed, ongoing medical management and lifestyle changes are the key.</p>
