# Preface {.unnumbered}

Version - DRAFT

Editors: Editors: Adam P Johnson MD, MPH; Matt Smith MD, PhD; and [Audible Bleeding Team](https://www.audiblebleeding.com/about-1/).

This content was developed by the [Audible Bleeding Team](https://www.audiblebleeding.com/about-1/) to accompany our board review podcast series. Each chapter covers a key domain of vascular surgery, essential for board review preparation, and is associated with an Audible Bleeding episode which you can access through the link embedded into the text.

## Usage

This e-book is intended to be an easily accessible online review paired with our podcast content to help streamline exam preparation. This e-book is by no means a comprehensive of all knowledge needed to be a safe and effective vascular surgeon and should not be your only text to review for exams. Pairing this review text with a more comprehensive textbook and review questions can help to organize and structure you studying.
