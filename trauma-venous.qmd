**Three Types of Major Abdominal Venous Injuries**

1.  Inferior Vena Cava (IVC) - Most commonly seen in blunt liver injury due to relationship of liver with IVC

2.  Portal Vein

3.  Superior Mesenteric Vein (SMV)

**General Principles**

1.  Pre-operative planning with appropriate resuscitation and blood products available

2.  Keep in mind coordination with other surgical teams and anesthesia

3.  Patients with abdominal venous injuries likely to be polytrauma patients, approach to assess and repair injuries should be time efficient

## Inferior Vena Cava

Anatomy

-   Can be divided into 4 segments

    -   Infrarenal segment

    -   From inferior portions of renal veins to iliac bifurcation

    -   Renal/Suprarenal segment

        -   2-3 cm of IVC, from renal vein to inferior portion of hepatic veins

        -   Includes renal veins and gonadal veins

    -   Retrohepatic segment

        -   Includes hepatic veins

    -   Suprahepatic segment

        -   Includes phrenic veins and pericardium to right atrium

Exposure

-   Infrarenal

    -   Right medial visceral rotation (Cattell-Braasch maneuver)

    -   Exposes in the proximal portion the IVC, inferior renal veins, 4th portion of duodenum, and pancreatic head

    -   Be aware of lumbar vessels posteriorly \>\> control with vessel loop or clamp

-   Renal/Suprarenal

    -   Right medial visceral rotation (Cattell-Braasch) and mobilizing liver cephalad

    -   Liver mobilization

        -   Divide the attachments of the liver to the diaphragm to be able to move liver cephalad

        -   Caution as there are posterior lumbar veins and other branches that can cause more significant bleeding

    -   Retrohepatic

        -   Right medial visceral rotation (Cattell-Braasch) and mobilizing liver cephalad

        -   However, usually ideal to not expose because hemostasis is lost when liver is lifted off segment

            -   Prior defect with formed hemostatic thrombus can be torn off with this maneuver and cause more bleeding

        -   Better to leave liver in place and not expose area id not necessary - Suprahepatic

            -   Divide xiphoid to open costal margins (approximately 2-3 cm cephalad)

### Management - IVC General Principles

Resuscitation is key in damage-control surgery

Management is dependent on location of injury

Interposition grafts not readily performed due to inefficiency of time

Control of Bleeding

-   IVC injuries considered Zone I retroperitoneal hematomas

-   Follow general principles of gaining proximal and distal control

    -   Can use low profile sponge sticks (Kittner sponge stick) or manual pressure

    -   Be prepared to refine where you control as the dissection progresses

-   May require Total Hepatic Isolation to locate bleeding behind the liver - Isolate all bleeding from IVC and hepatic vein confluence

    -   Control liver inflow - PORTA HEPATIS (via Pringle maneuver)

        -   Portal Vein - Accounts for 70-80% of hepatic inflow

        -   Hepatic Artery

    -   Control liver outflow - HEPATIC VEINS

        -   Confluence of hepatic vein with IVC

        -   Can be accessed below diaphragm or in the chest

-   Other options for bleeding control if total hepatic isolation not successful

    -   Supraceliac aortic clamp

        -   Can be considered if bleeding continues to help identify injury

        -   Last option, usually unsurvivable

    -   Place patient on bypass

    -   Atriocaval Shunt (Schrock shunt)[@schrock1968]

        -   Shunts lower body blood to the right atrium

        -   Can be accomplished with large chest tube with extra hole cut near base

        -   Chest tube clamped at base and inserted via purse string suture at the right atrial appendage \> advanced to infrarenal IVC

        -   Place Rommel tourniquet below area of suprarenal IVC (above the renal veins and last hole in tube)

        -   Second Rommel tourniquet placed above hepatic veins in intrapericardial IVC

Non-operative management

-   Generally well-tolerated due to low pressure system and difficulty of exposure increasing risk of more bleeding

    -   Especially for suprarenal and retrohepatic segments

-   Option for blunt mechanism of injuries

-   If patient is hemodynamically stable and there are no other associated injuries, can consider non-operative management with serial imaging (CT with contrast)

Operative management

-   Primary repair

    -   Option for partial tears without risk of narrowing lumen

        -   Narrowing lumen increases risk of thrombosis and thromboembolism

    -   Recommend figure of 8 of 16 to repair with 4-0 prolene suture on SH (small half circle) needle

    -   Tips

        -   Larger needles are easier to visualize in cases with high amounts of bleeding

        -   When first suture is placed, recommend lifting on either side of suture with both strands to elevate the defect and maintain tension \>\> improves visualization and placement of subsequent sutures to achieve full thickness bites

-   Ligation

    -   Well-tolerated for infrarenal segment IVC
    -   Not a viable option renal/suprarenal, retrohepatic, and suprahepatic IVC due to compromised outflow of vital organ structures (ie kidneys and liver)

### Management - Infrarenal IVC

Non-operative management

-   Patient with blunt injuries and hemodynamically stables

Operative Repair

-   Preferred as exposure is easiest in comparison to all other segments

-   Primary Repair

    -   SH needle on 4-0 prolene

    -   Avoid luminal narrowing of IVC to prevent thrombosis/thromboembolism

-   Ligation

    -   Ligation can be tolerated

    -   Ligation is appropriate when primary repair narrows lumen or if primary repair cannot be performed due to damage-control nature of operation

    -   Empirical 4-compartment fasciotomies of lower extremities is dependent on patient's resuscitation status

    -   Recommend fasciotomy if patient received large volumes of fluids/products, continues to be hemodynamically tenuous, anticipate long recovery

### Management - Renal/Suprarenal IVC

Non-operative Management

-   Preferred due to location of injury \>\> similar to retrohepatic and suprahepatic segments

-   Exposure of segment may increase risk of bleeding, increase size of defect, or unroof hemostasis formed

Operative

-   Primary Repair

    -   Option if liver mobilization does not increase size of defect/tear

    -   Follow principles as described above

-   Ligation - Not as well tolerated as infrarenal segment due to compromised of outflow to renal veins

### Management - Retrohepatic IVC

Non-operative Management

-   Preferred due to location of injury

-   Liver provides hemostasis due to overlying pressure

-   If liver mobilized, can cause more significant bleeding

Operative

-   Primary Repair

    -   Not preferred

    -   Option if patient continues to be hemodynamically unstable, requires blood products

    -   Careful liver mobilization due to multiple branch points and high risk of tear \> will likely require total hepatic isolation for bleeding control

-   Ligation - Not as well tolerated due to compromised outflow of both renal and hepatic veins, can cause both kidney and liver ischemia

### Management - Suprahepatic IVC

Non-operative Management

-   Preferred due to location of injury, difficult to access

-   Liver provides hemostasis due to overlying pressure

-   If liver mobilized, can cause more significant bleeding

Operative

-   Primary Repair

    -   Not preferred

    -   Will likely require total hepatic isolation for bleeding control

    -   Can consider supraceliac aortic clamp and/or atriocaval shunt for further control if needed

-   Ligation - Not as well tolerated due to compromised outflow of both renal and hepatic veins, can cause both kidney and liver ischemia

## Portal Vein and Superior Mesenteric Vein Injuries

Injuries to portal vein and SMV can be very catastrophic.

Non-isolated injury --- usually associated with other injuries (ie pancreatic + celiac vessels).

Exposure

-   Pringle maneuver to gain control of porta hepatis

-   Division of pancreatic head for better visualization

### Management

-   Resuscitation is key

    -   50% of blood volume is sequestered by splanchnic circulation

    -   Coordination with surgical team and anesthesia to resuscitate appropriately

    -   Consider insensible losses with open abdomen during OR time

-   Repair these injuries if possible

    -   Primary repair

    -   Interposition graft conduits

        -   Great saphenous vein

        -   PTFE

        -   Bovine pericardium

    -   Ligation an option in damage-control (high mortality)

        -   Temporizing measure to prepare for reconstruction once bleeding is controlled
